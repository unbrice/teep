# Tinfoil Provider Support

## Overview

Teep supports two Tinfoil providers with attestation verification and E2EE.
Tinfoil runs OpenAI-compatible inference in secure enclaves (TDX and SEV-SNP).
Attestation is fetched from a well-known HTTP endpoint on the enclave, verified
against hardware roots of trust and Sigstore supply-chain attestations, and
bound to TLS via the enclave's certificate fingerprint. E2EE uses the EHBP
protocol (HPKE-based full-body encryption).

The providers differ in their trust boundary:

- **`tinfoil_v3_cloud`**: Routes through the Tinfoil confidential model router
  (`inference.tinfoil.sh`). Teep verifies the router enclave only; the router
   internally re-attests and forwards to each inference enclave over
   TLS with per-enclave SPKI pinning (no EHBP on router-to-inference hop). The HPKE
  key bound in REPORTDATA is the router's key, not the inference enclave's key.
  This is architecturally analogous to the `nearcloud` provider in teep.

- **`tinfoil_v3_direct`**: Connects directly to per-model inference enclaves
  resolved from the router's `/.well-known/tinfoil-proxy` discovery endpoint
  (for example, backend domains such as `gemma4-31b-1.inf10.tinfoil.sh`).
  Teep verifies the selected inference enclave directly. The HPKE key bound in
  REPORTDATA belongs to that inference enclave, giving end-to-end encryption
  from teep to the model. This is architecturally analogous to the `neardirect`
  provider in teep.

Reference providers for implementation patterns:
- `nearcloud` (`internal/provider/nearcloud/`) — router-based gateway pattern
- `neardirect` (`internal/provider/neardirect/`) — direct per-model endpoint
  pattern with dynamic discovery (`internal/provider/neardirect/endpoints.go`)
- `chutes` — EHBP full-body encryption pattern

**Byte range notation**: This document uses Go slice notation throughout.
`REPORTDATA[0:32]` means bytes at indices 0 through 31 (32 bytes).
`REPORTDATA[32:64]` means bytes at indices 32 through 63 (32 bytes).

### AMD certificate retrieval

For both Tinfoil aliases, `teep serve` and `teep verify` use the AMD ASK/ARK
VCEK signing chains embedded in the pinned `go-sev-guest` dependency (Milan,
Genoa, and Turin). They obtain per-chip VCEK certificates from
`https://kds-proxy.tinfoil.sh`, preserving the chip ID and TCB query.
Unsupported signing chains and failed retrievals return errors; retrieval does
not switch to AMD KDS after a proxy failure. No filesystem cache is added.

The proxy supplies collateral, not a trust decision. Teep still verifies the
AMD certificate chain, report signature, report binding, and applicable factor
policy. Offline mode retains its explicit network-check exclusions. This change
does not change authorization reuse or initiate additional attestations.

The shared attestation client requires TLS 1.3, system WebPKI and CT, enables
HTTP/2 negotiation and connection reuse, and rejects redirects. The AMD-host
TLS 1.2 exception does not apply to Tinfoil's proxy. See the
[transport reference](../../transport/README.md). `TestTinfoilKDS` exercises
concurrent TLS 1.3/HTTP/2 retrieval and rejects corrupt certificates, invalid
report signatures, redirects, failed retrievals, and oversized responses.
`TestTinfoilKDSEmbeddedChains` checks chain isolation and unsupported URLs.

### V3 Attestation Format

Tinfoil's attestation endpoint supports both a legacy format and the current V3
format. V3 is the fully deployed format as of June 2026, providing client-nonce
freshness, GPU evidence binding, and a structured JSON response that enables
full external verification. Both `tinfoil_v3_cloud` and `tinfoil_v3_direct`
**always supply a client nonce** (`?nonce=<64hex>`) when fetching attestation
to guarantee V3 format is returned. The server returns V3 format when a nonce
is present; omitting the nonce may result in a legacy format response.
Implementations MUST reject any response that does not contain the `report_data`
structured field (i.e., any non-V3 response).

## Supported Endpoints

Teep handles the Tinfoil inference API surface exposed through the router and
direct model enclaves, while explicitly excluding non-inference operational
endpoints.

Teep target terminology in this document:
- Implement: endpoint is in-scope for this provider integration.
- Reject fail-closed: endpoint is explicitly excluded from the
  inference-provider surface; this applies to non-inference operational
  endpoints.

The endpoint coverage differs between providers:

| Endpoint | Upstream Path | E2EE | `tinfoil_v3_cloud` | `tinfoil_v3_direct` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chat completions | `/v1/chat/completions` | Yes (EHBP) | Supported | Supported | OpenAI-compatible chat; multimodal content arrays |
| Responses API | `/v1/responses` | Yes (EHBP) | Supported | Supported | OpenAI Responses API shape; tool-calling flows |
| Embeddings | `/v1/embeddings` | Yes (EHBP) | Supported | Supported | OpenAI embeddings |
| Audio transcriptions | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` | Attested TLS only when provider E2EE is disabled; fail-closed when E2EE is enabled | Guarded | Guarded | Both Tinfoil providers use SPKI-pinned TLS; multipart encryption through EHBP is not implemented |
| TTS (text-to-speech) | `/v1/audio/speech` | Yes (EHBP) | Supported | Supported | OpenAI-compatible speech synthesis |
| Audio endpoints (generic) | `/v1/audio/*` | Depends on registered route | Only registered `/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `/v1/audio/speech` | Only registered `/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `/v1/audio/speech` | Teep currently registers transcription and speech only |
| Models list | `/v1/models` | No (bodyless GET) | Supported (proxy-aggregated router list) | Supported (proxy-aggregated router list) | Teep's proxy aggregates provider model lists and prefixes IDs; direct routing does not use `/v1/models` for backend domain selection |
| Realtime (WebSocket) | `/v1/realtime` | — | — | — | Deferred to `tinfoil_endpoints.md` |
| File conversion | `/v1/convert/file` | — | — | — | Deferred to `tinfoil_endpoints.md` |
| Router operational endpoints | `/health`, `/.well-known/tinfoil-proxy`, etc. | No | Reject fail-closed as client API routes | Discovery use only for direct resolver | Operational/admin surface is not exposed as an inference provider API |

**Endpoint availability by provider**: Teep only exposes the registered proxy
routes listed above. `tinfoil_v3_cloud` forwards those routes to the router at
`inference.tinfoil.sh`. `tinfoil_v3_direct` resolves the model to a backend
enclave and forwards the same registered route to that enclave; the enclave's
own `tinfoil-config.yml` `api_routes` determines whether the upstream accepts
the path. Unsupported registered paths are propagated as upstream errors after
model resolution and attestation. Unregistered paths such as
`/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/rerank`, and `/v1/score` fail closed locally with
HTTP 400. `/v1/realtime` and `/v1/convert/file` are deferred to
`tinfoil_endpoints.md`.

Vision models (qwen3-vl-30b, gemma4-31b, kimi-k2-6) use the chat completions
endpoint with multimodal content arrays — no separate vision endpoint is needed.

For exchanges with non-empty HTTP bodies, EHBP encrypts the entire body
as a single AEAD stream. There are **no field-level gaps** for those encrypted
exchanges. Bodyless endpoints (for example `GET /v1/models`) are plaintext at
the HTTP-body layer by design.

### Endpoint Routing and Request-Shape Mechanics

To produce a compatible implementation without depending on upstream source
code, teep must follow these endpoint-specific routing mechanics:

1. `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses` are both first-class inference
   APIs and must both be routed through attested + EHBP-protected transports.
2. `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses` require `model` in the JSON body.
   Missing or non-string model is a fail-closed request error.
3. `/v1/audio/speech` uses JSON body model routing. Missing or non-string
   model is a fail-closed request error.
4. Audio upload-style paths (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`) use multipart request
   bodies. Current teep behavior forwards them only when provider E2EE is
   disabled; when E2EE is enabled for Tinfoil, the proxy fails closed before
   routing because multipart encryption through EHBP is not implemented.
   Attested, SPKI-pinned TLS remains required when E2EE is disabled.
5. For multipart audio requests, extract model from multipart field `model`.
   Missing or empty model is a fail-closed request error.
6. `/v1/models` is a bodyless proxy-aggregated GET. It is not EHBP-encrypted
   and does not trigger per-model attestation; it lists provider catalogs over
   normal HTTPS and rewrites each model ID to `provider:upstreamID`.
7. Requests with `stream=true` should preserve caller stream intent, and
   implementations should be prepared for usage metadata fields/chunks in both
   chat and responses streams.
8. Unknown or unsupported operational paths fail closed with explicit
    diagnostics. Only registered model-routed inference paths are forwarded
    after model resolution and attestation checks.
9. Vision-capable models are accessed through `/v1/chat/completions`; no
    separate vision endpoint is required.
10. Additional JSON model-routed `/v1/*` requests require explicit proxy route
    wiring before they are part of the supported API surface.

### Additional API Protocol Formats

`/v1/convert/file` and `/v1/realtime` are deferred to `tinfoil_endpoints.md`.

## Architecture Comparison with Existing Providers

### `tinfoil_v3_cloud` — Similarities to `nearcloud`

Both route through a single TEE-attested gateway or router. Teep independently
verifies the NEAR gateway and model evidence. For Tinfoil cloud, teep verifies
the router evidence, and the router verifies its model enclaves internally.

- Full-body encryption (EHBP replaces NEAR's Ed25519/XChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Pooled TLS with attested SPKI verification during each new handshake,
  as described in the [transport reference](../../transport/README.md)
- The attestation fetch checks the peer SPKI against the evidence; inference
  handshakes check the authenticated SPKI before sending request bytes
- Supply chain verification via Sigstore (replaces nearcloud's compose-hash/IMA)
- Router re-attests inference enclaves and uses a `TLSBoundRoundTripper`
   pattern pinned to each inference enclave's attested TLS fingerprint for
   forwarding

**Critical difference from nearcloud**: `tinfoil_v3_cloud` EHBP-encrypts the
body to the **router** HPKE key, not the inference enclave key. The router
decrypts the body in the router enclave, then re-encrypts to the inference
enclave using TLS (not EHBP). The HPKE key in `report_data` belongs to the
router enclave. This means plaintext request bodies are visible inside the
router enclave before re-encryption to the inference host.

### `tinfoil_v3_direct` — Similarities to `neardirect`

Both connect directly to per-model backend enclaves with per-model attestation
and SPKI pinning. Teep resolves the model's authority, verifies the selected
enclave, and encrypts inference to its attested key. Tinfoil uses EHBP; NEAR
uses its Ed25519/XChaCha20-Poly1305 protocol.

Parallel with `neardirect` provider behavior:
- Dynamic model-to-domain resolution, sourced from Tinfoil's proxy discovery
   endpoint rather than NEAR's endpoint discovery API
- One [atomic authorization](../../transport/README.md#routes-and-authorizations)
  contains the report, encryption key, and transport identity
  for the provider, model, and selected inference enclave authority
- An authorization miss starts or joins full verification. A TLS-binding
  mismatch fails the request and conditionally removes its authorization;
  subsequent requests require valid authorization under the
  [retry contract](../../transport/retries.md)
- EHBP encrypts to the **inference enclave's** HPKE key (not a gateway key)
- Same live TLS SPKI-to-attested-fingerprint enforcement used by other
   direct-attestation providers

**Critical security advantage over `tinfoil_v3_cloud`**: HPKE encryption targets
the inference enclave directly. Plaintext request bodies are never visible to
any intermediary — not even a Tinfoil-operated router enclave. Smaller TCB.

**Operational constraint**: `tinfoil_v3_direct` cannot use router-owned
functionality (tool routing, code execution orchestration, PII check proxy).
It is suitable for simple chat/responses/embeddings workloads where trust-
boundary minimization is more important than router feature coverage.

### Key Differences from All Existing Providers

Both Tinfoil providers share these differences from all existing teep providers:

1. **Attestation format**: Tinfoil uses its own V3 format — a structured JSON
   response with separate `cpu`, `gpu`, `nvswitch`, `report_data`,
   `certificate`, and `signature` fields. Not dstack, not chutes, not NEAR.
2. **Supply chain**: Sigstore verification of GitHub Actions build attestations
   (DSSE in-toto bundles), checked against component digests published in
   GitHub Releases. Teep fetches release and attestation data through
   `github-proxy.tinfoil.sh`. This is independent of the compose-hash / IMA
   supply chain used by other providers.
3. **REPORTDATA binding**: `[0:32]` = SHA-256(tls_fp || hpke || nonce ||
   gpu_hash || nvswitch_hash); `[32:64]` = zeros. Client nonce and GPU binding.
4. **E2EE protocol**: EHBP (RFC 9180 HPKE + AES-256-GCM), not
   Ed25519/XChaCha20-Poly1305 or ML-KEM-768/ChaCha20-Poly1305.
5. **HPKE key from attestation**: HPKE key in the `report_data.hpke_key`
   response field, authenticated by being part of the REPORTDATA[0:32] hash.
   Cipher suite is fixed (X25519_HKDF_SHA256 / HKDF_SHA256 / AES_256_GCM)
   per the EHBP spec. No key config endpoint needed. **For `tinfoil_v3_cloud`
   this is the router's key; for `tinfoil_v3_direct` this is the inference
   enclave's own key.**
6. **Hardware measurement verification**: TDX hardware platforms (MRTD, RTMR0)
   matched against a separate Sigstore-attested hardware measurements registry
   (`tinfoilsh/hardware-measurements`).
7. **Multi-platform code measurements**: Code attestation uses a unified
   `snp-tdx-multiplatform/v1` predicate that cross-matches SEV-SNP and TDX
   measurements from a single Sigstore bundle.
8. **SEV-SNP support**: Tinfoil enclaves can run on AMD SEV-SNP (not just TDX).
   The `cpu.platform` field in the attestation response determines which
   hardware verification path to take.
9. **GPU attestation binding**: GPU evidence is included in the attestation
   response and hash-bound into REPORTDATA (Option 2 from gpu_cpu_binding.md).
   GPU SPDM evidence and NVSwitch evidence are hash-bound into the CPU quote.
   Boot-time GPU attestation is fail-closed.
10. **No TEE.fail mitigations**: Like all current providers, Tinfoil has no
    Proof of Cloud participation, no vTPM, and no DCEA. TEE.fail is an open
    vulnerability. See "Authentication Chain 5" for full analysis.

## Authentication Chain Analysis

This section documents the complete authentication chains from hardware root
of trust through to the user's plaintext, explicitly comparing Tinfoil's
model against the gaps documented in `docs/attestation_gaps/dstack_integrity.md`
and `docs/attestation_gaps/model_weights.md`. The code agent must enforce every
link in these chains.

### Gap Comparison: Tinfoil vs. Dstack Providers

The dstack integrity gap (dstack_integrity.md) identifies that dstack-based
providers (Venice, Nearcloud, Neardirect) suffer from an **in-band discovery
gap**: the boot-chain registers MRTD, RTMR0–RTMR2 must be compared against
externally-sourced expected values, but no provider publishes those values in
a signed, machine-readable format. Operators must manually maintain measurement
allowlists, and provider infrastructure changes silently break verification.

The model weights gap (model_weights.md) documents that no dstack provider
includes model identity in the attestation chain. The Docker Compose manifest
binds the container image, but model weights are downloaded at runtime inside
the container — the attestation proves the correct software, not the correct
model.

**Tinfoil closes both gaps by design:**

1. **Boot-chain measurements are published in Sigstore.** Tinfoil's
   `pri-build-action` GitHub Actions workflow computes expected measurements
   for every deployment configuration and publishes them as a signed Sigstore
   bundle in the transparency log. Teep fetches the bundle and compares its
   measurement predicates against the hardware attestation report. There are
   no operator-maintained allowlists — the expected values are authenticated
   and machine-readable.

2. **Model weights are attested via dm-verity + Sigstore.** Tinfoil uses a
   tool called `modelwrap` to create a read-only volume containing model
   weights and compute a cryptographic commitment (dm-verity root hash) over
   it. This commitment is pinned in `tinfoil-config.yml`, whose SHA-256 hash
   is embedded in the kernel command line (measured into the attestation
   report). At runtime, the CVM mounts the model volume read-only and
   dm-verity validates every block read against the Merkle tree root hash.
   Any tampered block causes an I/O error. The `tinfoil-config.yml` and its
   model commitment are covered by the Sigstore bundle, so teep can verify
   that the model weights running in the enclave are exactly what was
   committed at build time.

3. **All disks are read-only and stateless.** The CVM mounts all virtual
   disks read-only and uses ramdisk for ephemeral data. There is no
   persistent writable state between boots. This eliminates the runtime
   weight substitution vector that model_weights.md identifies for dstack
   providers, where the inference engine could download alternative weights.

4. **Configuration is measured into the attestation.** The
   `tinfoil-config.yml` file (containing the model commitment, container
   images, CVM version, and resource allocation) has its SHA-256 embedded in
   the kernel command line. Since the kernel command line is measured into
   RTMR2 (TDX) or the launch measurement (SEV-SNP), any change to the
   configuration produces a different attestation that will not match the
   Sigstore bundle.

5. **No per-deployment-class variation.** Unlike dstack, where RTMR0 varies
   with CPU/RAM/GPU count and operators must pin multiple values, Tinfoil's
   Sigstore bundle is scoped to a specific deployment configuration. The
   bundle contains the exact expected measurements for that configuration.
   If Tinfoil changes the hardware profile, a new Sigstore bundle is
   published.

| Gap | Dstack Providers | Tinfoil |
|---|---|---|
| Boot-chain register discovery | Out-of-band, operator-maintained | In-band via Sigstore bundle |
| MRSEAM / firmware identity | Derivable from Intel, needs manual pin | Published in Sigstore bundle |
| MRTD / CVM image identity | Derivable from dstack build, needs manual pin | Published in Sigstore bundle |
| RTMR0 / hardware config | Per-deployment-class, no signed publication | Published in Sigstore bundle |
| RTMR1-2 / kernel+rootfs | Per-image build, no signed publication | Published in Sigstore bundle |
| Model weight authentication | Not attested (downloaded at runtime) | dm-verity root hash in attested config |
| Model identity in attestation | Not present | config.yml commitment → kernel cmdline → RTMR2 |
| Configuration authenticity | Compose hash in MRCONFIGID | config.yml hash in kernel cmdline + Sigstore |
| Measurement baseline maintenance | Manual operator burden | Automated via Sigstore transparency log |
| GPU attestation (boot-time) | Not enforced at boot | nvattest + SPDM verified at boot; fail-closed |
| GPU-CPU binding | Not implemented (`cpu_gpu_chain` = Fail) | GPU evidence hash in REPORTDATA (Option 2, Pass) |
| GPU topology validation | Not validated | 8-GPU + 4-NVSwitch PCIe mesh validated at boot |
| TEE.fail defense | Proof of Cloud (conditional) | None (same vulnerability) |
| vTPM / DCEA | Not implemented | Not implemented |

Provider applicability for this comparison table:
- Rows in this table describe Tinfoil's attestation design shared by both
   providers unless a later provider-specific status section narrows scope.
- Provider boundary differences are authoritative in
   "Provider-Specific Cryptographic Gap Status" and the Chain 4/5
   provider-scope rules.

### Gap Status Determination Rules

This section makes the gap conclusions mechanically decidable from verifier
outputs, rather than narrative interpretation.

1. **Dstack in-band discovery gap analogue (boot-measurement publication):**
   `Closed` only when both conditions hold:
   - `sigstore_code_verified` is `Pass` from a verified DSSE bundle for the
     deployment repo, and
   - for TDX, hardware platform matching (MRTD+RTMR0) against
     `hardware-measurements` passes; for SEV-SNP, launch measurement matching
     against the verified multi-platform predicate passes.
   Any failure or `Skip` in those checks means `Open`.

2. **Model-weights identity gap (runtime weight substitution):**
   `Closed` only when `sigstore_code_verified` is `Pass` and the measured chain
   explicitly ties the verified config to dm-verity root commitments
   (`measured_model_weights=Pass` with transitive detail). If the Sigstore
   chain fails/skip, this gap is `Open`.

3. **GPU-to-CPU binding gap (Option 2):**
   `Closed` only when `cpu_gpu_chain` and the NVIDIA evidence factors
   (`nvidia_payload_present`, `nvidia_signature`, and `nvidia_claims`) pass in
   the same verification event. A failed factor that is allowed by policy may
   avoid request blocking, but the gap remains `Open`. Missing required
   evidence, malformed normalization input, SPDM failure, or an unresolved
   topology-required NVSwitch failure makes it `Open`.

4. **TEE.fail key-extraction gap:**
   Always `Open` until an independent CPU identity registry / anti-relay
   mitigation is enforced (for example Proof-of-Cloud identity registration,
   DCEA/vTPM-backed identity, or equivalent hardware-rooted anti-forgery
   control). Passing quote/supply-chain/E2EE checks does not close this gap.

### Provider-Specific Cryptographic Gap Status

This section makes provider differences explicit so risk status is decidable
without implementation-specific interpretation.

| Gap / Property | `tinfoil_v3_cloud` | `tinfoil_v3_direct` |
|---|---|---|
| Teep-to-target request-body confidentiality | `Closed` to router enclave, `Open` to inference enclave (router can read plaintext after EHBP unwrap) | `Closed` to inference enclave (EHBP terminates at model enclave) |
| Teep cryptographic proof of model-enclave identity | `Open` at teep boundary (teep proves router identity only) | `Closed` when attestation + SPKI + Sigstore checks pass for that model enclave |
| Teep cryptographic proof of model-enclave freshness | `Open` at teep boundary (freshness proven for router only) | `Closed` when nonce-bound V3 attestation verifies for the model enclave |
| Router-to-model confidentiality/integrity channel | TLS + SPKI pinned by router (not EHBP) | N/A |
| Supply-chain identity checked by teep | Router repo | Per-model repo |
| TEE.fail key-extraction risk | `Open` | `Open` |

Status interpretation rules:
- A row marked `Closed` means all listed cryptographic verifications for that
   provider/hop are required and fail-closed.
- A row marked `Open` means the property is not cryptographically established
   at that verifier boundary, even if adjacent checks pass.
- For cloud-mode details, see
  [tinfoil_cloud_integrity.md](../../attestation_gaps/tinfoil_cloud_integrity.md).
  The core factor rule is that teep-verified factors apply to the router
  enclave unless the factor detail explicitly says otherwise. Backend
  inference-enclave integrity is router-enforced, not independently
  client-enforced by teep in `tinfoil_v3_cloud`.

Replay/downgrade status rules (both providers):
- Attestation replay resistance is `Closed` only when nonce generation is
   cryptographically random, unique per attestation fetch, and
   `report_data.nonce` plus REPORTDATA hash binding both verify.
- Attestation format-downgrade resistance is `Closed` only when non-V3
   responses are rejected (missing structured `report_data` fails closed).
- EHBP downgrade resistance is `Closed` only when encrypted exchanges never
   fall back to plaintext on missing/invalid EHBP headers and mode mismatches
   fail closed.

### Authentication Chain 1: CVM Environment (Hardware → Code)

This chain proves that the enclave is running the expected firmware, kernel,
and application code on genuine hardware. Every link must be verified; a
break at any point means the enclave identity is unproven.

**What teep must verify (enforcement checklist):**

1. Validate hardware attestation report signature against manufacturer cert
   chain (AMD ARK→ASK→VCEK or Intel root→PCK→QE). → `tee_quote_structure`
2. Compare all measurement registers against values from Sigstore bundle:
   - TDX code registers: RTMR1, RTMR2 against the multi-platform predicate
   - SEV-SNP code register: launch measurement against `snp_measurement`
   → `sigstore_code_verified` (code measurement match)
3. Verify Sigstore bundle: DSSE signature, Fulcio certificate, SCT,
   transparency log entry, observer timestamp. → `sigstore_code_verified`
4. Apply platform-specific policy checks:
   - TDX: TD_ATTRIBUTES, XFAM, MR_SEAM whitelist, RTMR3==0, zero fields
   - SEV-SNP: guest policy (Debug=false, SMT, etc.), TCB minimums
   → `tee_hardware_config`
5. Match TDX MRTD + RTMR0 against hardware measurements registry.
   → `tee_boot_config` (hardware-platform measurement validation)
6. Verify RTMR3 is all zeros (no unexpected runtime extensions).

### Authentication Chain 2: Encryption Keys (Hardware → Plaintext)

This chain proves that only the attested enclave can decrypt user data. Every
link must hold; a break means an intermediary could read plaintext.

```
Link 1: Key Generation Inside Enclave
│   At boot, enclave generates:
│     - ECDSA key pair for TLS (private key in encrypted memory)
│     - X25519 key pair for HPKE/EHBP (private key in encrypted memory)
│   Private keys never leave enclave memory.
│   Destroyed when enclave terminates (stateless CVM).

```

**What teep must verify (enforcement checklist):**

1. Extract TLS public key fingerprint from `report_data.tls_key_fp` of the
   verified attestation response (authenticated by REPORTDATA[0:32] hash).
   → `tls_key_binding`
2. On every TLS connection to the enclave, compute SHA-256 of the server's
   PKIX-encoded public key and constant-time compare against the attested
   fingerprint. Mismatch → re-attest → mismatch again → block.
   → `tls_key_binding`
3. Extract HPKE public key from response `report_data.hpke_key` (verified via
   REPORTDATA[0:32] hash). → `e2ee_capable`
4. Use **only** this attested HPKE key for EHBP encryption. Never accept a
   key from any other source. The cipher suite is fixed:
   X25519_HKDF_SHA256 / HKDF_SHA256 / AES_256_GCM. → `e2ee_capable`
5. Encrypt every request body via EHBP before sending. No plaintext POST
   requests. → `e2ee_usable`
6. Require `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` header on every response. If absent, fail
   closed. → `e2ee_usable`
7. Decrypt and AEAD-verify every response chunk. On any auth failure, abort
   the response. → `e2ee_usable`

### Authentication Chain 3: Enclave Chaining (Router → Model) — `tinfoil_v3_cloud` only

Tinfoil uses a confidential model router that forwards requests to
per-model inference enclaves. Each hop is independently attested and
channel-authenticated. This chain applies only to `tinfoil_v3_cloud`. In `tinfoil_v3_direct`
the client verifies the inference enclave directly and there is no router hop.

**How the router re-attests inference enclaves**:

1. The router fetches each inference enclave's attestation from
   `/.well-known/tinfoil-attestation` and verifies signature, measurement,
   and hardware-policy constraints before admitting that enclave to routing.
2. For TDX hosts, router verification includes hardware-measurement matching
   against the published `hardware-measurements` registry.
3. The router compares verified enclave measurements to the model's expected
   measurement profile before marking the target routable.
4. The router stores the verified inference TLS SPKI fingerprint and binds
   forwarding connections to that fingerprint on every TLS handshake.
5. There is **no EHBP** on the router-to-inference hop — only TLS with SPKI
   pinning. The inference enclave's HPKE key is not used by the router.
6. The router continuously revalidates backend health/identity (periodic
   refresh and fingerprint-change checks) and removes failing backends.

Freshness caveat for `tinfoil_v3_cloud`:
- Teep proves nonce freshness for the router hop only.
- Inference-hop freshness is enforced by router policy, not directly by teep.
- Therefore, teep must report this as an `Open` boundary-level gap in
  provider-level risk summaries (while still allowing `tinfoil_v3_cloud` when
  policy permits router-mediated trust).

```
Client (teep proxy — tinfoil_v3_cloud)
  │
  │  1. Verify router attestation (V3: Sigstore + hardware quote)
  │  2. TLS-bind to router's attested TLS fingerprint
  │  3. EHBP-encrypt request to router's attested HPKE key
  │     (Router HPKE key is in REPORTDATA; NOT inference enclave's key)
  │
  ▼
Model Router Enclave (tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router)
  │  Router decrypts body (EHBP unwrap) — plaintext visible here
  │
  │  4. Router verifies inference enclave attestation internally
  │  5. Router pins to inference enclave TLS fingerprint via TLSBoundRoundTripper
  │  6. Router forwards request over TLS (no EHBP) to inference enclave
  │
  ▼
Model Inference Enclave (e.g. gemma4-31b-1.inf10.tinfoil.sh)
  │
  │  7. Inference runs on dm-verity-attested model weights
  │  8. Response returned over TLS to router, then to teep client
  │
  ▼
Client receives response (EHBP-authenticated from router boundary only)
```

**Implication for teep (`tinfoil_v3_cloud`):** Teep verifies the **router**
enclave only. The router performs second-hop verification internally. The
router's Sigstore bundle attests the code that performs this verification;
if the router code were modified to skip model enclave verification, the code
measurement would change and teep's Sigstore comparison would fail. This makes
the chain self-enforcing.

**Trust boundary note**: Request body plaintext is accessible inside the
router enclave (after EHBP decryption). The router is Tinfoil-operated and
its code is Sigstore-attested, so this is an accepted risk. Users requiring
inference-enclave-direct encryption should use `tinfoil_v3_direct`.

**Factor validation implications**:
- `tls_key_binding`, `e2ee_capable`, `e2ee_usable`,
  `nonce_in_reportdata`, and `tee_reportdata_binding` validate the router
  attestation and router EHBP/TLS keys.
- `build_transparency_log`, `component_recognition`,
  `provider_signer_recognition`, `component_signature_recognition`,
  `sigstore_code_verified`, and `measured_model_weights` validate the router
  component (`tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router`) and the router code path
  that performs backend admission control.
- GPU and NVSwitch factors for `tinfoil_v3_cloud` describe the attested router
  boundary visible to teep. They must not be interpreted as client-enforced
  proof that the selected model inference enclave had fresh GPU/SPDM evidence
  for a specific request.
- Policies requiring inference-enclave end-to-end encryption, fresh
  client-verifiable backend evidence, or client-enforced backend GPU/SPDM
  state should use `tinfoil_v3_direct` or fail closed for cloud mode.

### Authentication Chain 3b: Direct Inference Connection — `tinfoil_v3_direct` only

In `tinfoil_v3_direct`, teep verifies the inference enclave directly and
EHBP-encrypts to its own attested HPKE key. There is no router intermediary.

```
Client (teep proxy — tinfoil_v3_direct)
  │
  │  1. Resolve model → inference enclave domain
  │     (GET https://inference.tinfoil.sh/.well-known/tinfoil-proxy)
  │
  │  2. Verify inference enclave attestation (V3: Sigstore + hardware quote)
  │     (per-model Sigstore repo, e.g. tinfoilsh/confidential-gemma4-31b)
  │  3. TLS-bind to inference enclave's attested TLS fingerprint
  │  4. EHBP-encrypt request to inference enclave's own attested HPKE key
  │     (Inference enclave HPKE key is in REPORTDATA — end-to-end encrypted)
  │
  ▼
Model Inference Enclave (e.g. gemma4-31b-1.inf10.tinfoil.sh)
  │
  │  5. Inference enclave decrypts body (EHBP unwrap)
  │     No intermediary has seen plaintext
  │  6. Inference runs on dm-verity-attested model weights
  │  7. Response EHBP-encrypted to client with inference enclave's key
  │
  ▼
Client receives AEAD-authenticated response (from inference enclave directly)
```

**Implication for teep (`tinfoil_v3_direct`):** Teep verifies the inference
enclave directly. The supply chain repo and expected measurements correspond
to the per-model enclave repository (e.g. `tinfoilsh/confidential-gemma4-31b`),
not the router. EHBP encryption targets the inference enclave's own HPKE key,
so plaintext request bodies are never visible to the router or any other
Tinfoil infrastructure.

### Authentication Chain 4: Model Weight Integrity

Unlike dstack providers where model weights are downloaded at runtime and
not covered by attestation, Tinfoil binds model weights into the attestation
chain through a combination of dm-verity and configuration pinning.

```

  │
  │  Contains: pri-build-action output with expected measurements
  │  Including: hash of tinfoil-config.yml
  │
  ▼
tinfoil-config.yml (committed to GitHub)
  │
  │  Contains: modelwrap dm-verity root hash for each model volume
  │  Contains: container image digests
  │  Contains: CVM version, resource allocation
  │  SHA-256 hash embedded in kernel command line
  │
  ▼
Kernel command line → measured into RTMR2 (TDX) / launch measurement (SEV-SNP)
  │
  │  At boot: CVM verifies config on disk matches attested hash
  │  Mismatch → boot aborts
  │
  ▼
dm-verity volume mount
  │
  │  Model weight volume mounted read-only
  │  dm-verity Merkle tree root hash from tinfoil-config.yml
  │  Every block read validated by kernel dm-verity subsystem
  │  Tampered block → I/O error → inference fails
  │
  ▼
vLLM loads model from verified volume
  │
  │  Volume is read-only; no runtime download possible
  │  All .safetensors shards validated block-by-block
  │
  ▼
Inference output from attested model weights
```

**What teep must verify (enforcement checklist):**

Teep does not directly verify dm-verity — that happens inside the CVM kernel.
Teep's role is to verify the chain that makes dm-verity trustworthy:

1. Verify the Sigstore bundle for the deployment repo (contains the
   measurements derived from the tinfoil-config.yml). → `sigstore_code_verified`
2. Compare attestation register values against the Sigstore bundle to confirm
   the CVM booted with the attested config (which pins the model dm-verity
   hash). → `sigstore_code_verified`
3. The `measured_model_weights` factor reports `Pass` for Tinfoil when
   `sigstore_code_verified` passes, because the Sigstore chain transitively
   authenticates the model weights via config.yml → dm-verity. The detail
   string explains the transitive chain.

#### Attestation-Gap Status Rules: Model Weights (Provider Scope)

This section makes model-weight gap status mechanically decidable and
provider-specific.

- Applies to: both providers (`tinfoil_v3_cloud`, `tinfoil_v3_direct`).
- For `tinfoil_v3_direct`, model-weight identity gap is `Closed` only when:
  1. `sigstore_code_verified=Pass` for the per-model inference repo,
  2. platform measurement comparison passes for the attested inference enclave,
  3. and `measured_model_weights=Pass` with transitive chain detail
     `Sigstore -> config hash -> dm-verity root`.
- For `tinfoil_v3_cloud`, model-weight identity at the teep boundary is
  `Closed` only at the router-mediated trust boundary, meaning:
  1. router attestation/supply-chain checks pass,
  2. router-verified backend identity policy is part of the attested router
     code path,
  3. and teep records that model-weight proof is transitive via router policy
     (not direct enclave verification by teep).
- Any `Fail` or `Skip` in required checks yields `Open`.

### Authentication Chain 5: GPU Attestation and CPU-GPU Binding

Tinfoil uses NVIDIA GPUs (Hopper H100/H200, Blackwell) with NVIDIA
Confidential Computing. GPU attestation uses Option 2 from
`docs/attestation_gaps/gpu_cpu_binding.md`: GPU evidence hash in TDX/SEV-SNP
REPORTDATA.

#### What Tinfoil Implements

**Boot-time GPU attestation (fail-closed):**
- At CVM boot, the `nvattest` tool performs local NVIDIA GPU attestation
  (`nvattest attest --device gpu --verifier local`).
- SPDM reports are collected from each GPU and validated locally.
- For 8-GPU HGX Hopper systems: NVSwitch attestation and full PCIe topology
   validation (8 GPUs + 4 NVSwitches mesh integrity) are enforced.
- For 8-GPU HGX Blackwell systems (B200/B300): in-guest NVSwitch evidence is
   not exposed under Blackwell MPT, so NVSwitch collection is skipped by design.
- If GPU attestation fails, the CVM sets GPU ready state to
  `ACCEPTING_CLIENT_REQUESTS_FALSE` and boot aborts. **No enclave starts
  without passing GPU attestation.**

**Runtime GPU evidence collection:**
- The attestation endpoint (`/.well-known/tinfoil-attestation?nonce=<hex>`)
   collects fresh SPDM evidence from all GPUs and collects NVSwitch evidence
   only when topology/architecture requires it.
- Evidence is collected via NVML APIs (`GetConfComputeGpuAttestationReport`)
  with the client-supplied nonce passed through to the GPU.
- GPU evidence is returned in the attestation response as `gpu` and
   optionally `nvswitch` JSON fields alongside the CPU report.

**GPU evidence hash in REPORTDATA:**
- REPORTDATA is computed as:
  ```
  REPORTDATA[0:32] = SHA-256(tls_key_fp || hpke_key || nonce || gpu_evidence_hash || nvswitch_evidence_hash)
  REPORTDATA[32:64] = zeros
  ```
  Where `gpu_evidence_hash = SHA-256(gpu_evidence_json)` and
  `nvswitch_evidence_hash = SHA-256(nvswitch_evidence_json)`.
- This cryptographically binds GPU evidence to the TDX/SEV-SNP CPU quote.
  The CPU hardware signs REPORTDATA, so the GPU evidence hash is
  hardware-authenticated.

**This implements Option 2 from gpu_cpu_binding.md** (GPU evidence hash in
TDX REPORTDATA). Tinfoil also extends it to include NVSwitch evidence.

#### Router vs. Model Enclaves

For `tinfoil_v3_cloud`, the Tinfoil confidential model router
(`inference.tinfoil.sh`) handles model routing. Teep verifies the **router**
enclave, and the router verifies model enclaves internally (see Authentication
Chain 3). For `tinfoil_v3_direct`, Teep resolves and verifies the selected
model enclave directly. If the attested target reports no GPUs (e.g., an
SEV-SNP router without GPUs), GPU evidence in REPORTDATA will reflect that
target's GPU state; `nvswitch_expected` normalization must still apply, and
absent GPU evidence must fail closed.

#### Gap Analysis: GPU CPU Binding (Provider Scope + Status)

| Issue from gpu_cpu_binding.md | `tinfoil_v3_cloud` | `tinfoil_v3_direct` |
|---|---|---|
| **Gap 1: TEE.fail** | `Open` (unmitigated) | `Open` (unmitigated) |
| **Gap 2: CPU-to-GPU binding** | `Closed` only for router enclave evidence path; model enclave GPU proof is router-mediated | `Closed` when inference-enclave GPU hash binding verifies |
| **GPU nonce freshness** | `Closed` for router attestation nonce path | `Closed` for inference-enclave nonce path |
| **GPU topology validation** | `Closed` when topology-conditional NVSwitch rules pass for attested target | `Closed` when topology-conditional NVSwitch rules pass for attested target |
| **vTPM / DCEA (Option 3)** | `Open` (not implemented) | `Open` (not implemented) |
| **TDX Connect / TDISP (Option 5)** | `Open` (not implemented) | `Open` (not implemented) |
| **Proof of Cloud (Option 1)** | `Open` (not implemented) | `Open` (not implemented) |

Status rules:
- `cpu_gpu_chain` is `Closed` only when `cpu_gpu_chain=Pass` and
   required NVIDIA evidence factors pass in the same verification event.
   Policy may allow a failing factor not to block inference, but that does not
   close the GPU-chain gap.
- For `tinfoil_v3_cloud`, GPU-chain closure is scoped to the router enclave at
   the teep verification boundary.
- For `tinfoil_v3_direct`, GPU-chain closure is scoped to the inference enclave
   directly verified by teep.
- Missing required evidence, malformed normalization inputs, hash mismatch,
   SPDM failure, or required NVSwitch absence makes the gap `Open`.
- The known NVSwitch JSON re-encoding mismatch is reported as a separate
  `nvswitch_binding` failure; it does not by itself make `cpu_gpu_chain` fail
  when the GPU evidence hash and REPORTDATA hash verify with the reported
  NVSwitch hash.

#### TEE.fail Implications for Tinfoil

Tinfoil's security posture against TEE.fail is identical to other providers
(NearAI, dstack): **no specific mitigation exists**. If an attacker extracts
attestation signing keys via DDR5 memory bus interposition (applicable to
both TDX and SEV-SNP):

1. The attacker can forge quotes with arbitrary REPORTDATA, including
   fabricated TLS key fingerprints and HPKE keys.
2. The attacker can forge measurement registers (MRTD, RTMRs) that match the
   Sigstore-expected values.
3. The Sigstore supply chain verification would pass (it only checks that
   measurements match — it cannot detect that the quote was forged).
4. E2EE would be defeated: the attacker's fabricated HPKE key would be
   accepted as the enclave's key.
5. The GPU evidence relay attack applies: an attacker with extracted keys can
   relay real GPU evidence from the legitimate machine while fabricating the
   CPU quote to bind their own keys. The GPU hash in REPORTDATA provides no
   defense when the attacker controls REPORTDATA (via TEE.fail).

**Tinfoil-specific nuance**: Tinfoil's hermetically built CVM image is
stronger than dstack in one respect — if an attacker forges a quote, they
must also provide a complete Tinfoil CVM environment (or intercept
connections), which is harder than with dstack where the attacker could run
arbitrary code. However, this is defense-in-obscurity, not a cryptographic
mitigation.

Provider applicability:
- Applies to both providers equally (`tinfoil_v3_cloud` and
   `tinfoil_v3_direct`): TEE.fail remains `Open` regardless of whether teep
   terminates EHBP at router or inference enclave.

Status rule:
- TEE.fail gap status is always `Open` for both providers until an
   independent anti-relay / CPU-identity mechanism is enforced, and cannot be
   closed by quote validity, REPORTDATA binding, Sigstore matching, or EHBP.

**What teep should do:**
1. `cpu_id_registry`: Reserve this factor for **Proof of Cloud CPU identity
   registration** checks (proofofcloud.org), which can cover both TDX and
   SEV-SNP platform identity registration. Do not reuse this factor for
   MRTD/RTMR or launch-measurement comparisons; those are covered by
   `tee_boot_config` / `sigstore_code_verified` and related report details.
   Since Tinfoil currently has no Proof of Cloud participation, keep
   `cpu_id_registry` in default `allow_fail` until Proof-of-Cloud-backed
   identity registration is implemented.
2. Apply the same TEE.fail residual risk assessment as for other providers.
3. When DCEA/vTPM support becomes available, add verification support.
4. `cpu_gpu_chain`: `Pass` only when GPU evidence is present and its hash is
   verified in REPORTDATA (missing GPU evidence = `Fail`).
5. `nvidia_payload_present`, `nvidia_signature`, and `nvidia_claims`: `Pass`
   only when GPU SPDM evidence is present and verifies per GPU (missing GPU
   evidence = `Fail`).
6. NVSwitch evidence is topology-conditional: if GPU evidence indicates an
   NVSwitch-backed topology (for example 8-GPU HGX Hopper / mesh fabric),
   `nvswitch` evidence and `report_data.nvswitch_evidence_hash` are required;
   8-GPU Blackwell (B200/B300) may legitimately omit NVSwitch evidence under
   MPT; if required evidence is missing, malformed, or cryptographically
   invalid, GPU/NVSwitch-related factors must fail closed. If the evidence is
   present but only the raw JSON hash mismatches because of the known
   server-side re-encoding bug, `nvswitch_binding` fails while
   `tee_reportdata_binding` and `cpu_gpu_chain` may still pass through the
   reported-hash workaround described below.

#### REPORTDATA Verification

1. Extract `tls_key_fp` and `hpke_key` from the response `report_data`
   field (not from REPORTDATA bytes directly).
2. Recompute `gpu_evidence_hash = SHA-256(raw_gpu_json)` from the `gpu` field
   in the attestation response. **Important**: The hash must be computed over
   the exact bytes received in the HTTP response, not a parsed-and-reserialized
   JSON object. Different JSON libraries produce different byte sequences for
   identical data (key ordering, whitespace). The implementation must extract
   the `gpu` field as a `json.RawMessage` and hash those raw bytes directly
   (i.e., `sha256.Sum256([]byte(rawGPUMessage))`) without re-encoding.
3. Recompute `nvswitch_evidence_hash = SHA-256(raw_nvswitch_json)` from the
   `nvswitch` field (if present; omitted from hash input when absent). Same raw-byte
   requirement as the GPU evidence hash above. For the known Tinfoil
   NVSwitch JSON re-encoding issue, teep records the raw-byte mismatch and
   then verifies REPORTDATA with the reported `nvswitch_evidence_hash` so the
   TLS SPKI, HPKE key, nonce, and GPU evidence hash remain hardware-bound.
   See
   [tinfoil_nvswitch_json.md](../../attestation_gaps/tinfoil_nvswitch_json.md)
   for the detailed server-side cause.
4. Enforce field/hash consistency:
    - `gpu` evidence is REQUIRED. If `gpu` is absent or empty, fail closed
       and set `cpu_gpu_chain` and NVIDIA evidence factors to `Fail`.
    - If `gpu` is present, `report_data.gpu_evidence_hash` must be present and
       equal the recomputed hash (constant-time compare via
       `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`, consistent with the REPORTDATA comparison
      standard used elsewhere in this document).
    - Determine `nvswitch_expected` using this deterministic normalization
      algorithm (in order):
      1. Parse `gpu` as JSON object and require `gpu.evidences` array.
      2. Set `gpu_count = len(gpu.evidences)`.
      3. Inspect `gpu.evidences[*].arch` values to detect GPU architectures.
      4. If `gpu_count == 8` AND any GPU arch value is unrecognized (not
         `HOPPER` and not `BLACKWELL`), fail closed and set `cpu_gpu_chain`
         and NVIDIA evidence factors to `Fail`. Unknown
         architectures on 8-GPU systems must not silently skip NVSwitch
         verification.
      5. If `gpu_count == 8` AND at least one GPU arch is `HOPPER`, set
         `nvswitch_expected = true`. This is the only condition that requires
         NVSwitch evidence.
      6. Otherwise (single/dual/quad GPU, or 8-GPU Blackwell-only systems),
         set `nvswitch_expected = false`.
      7. If required fields for this derivation are malformed, missing, or
         ambiguous (for example `gpu` present but `gpu.evidences` missing),
         fail closed and set `cpu_gpu_chain` and NVIDIA evidence factors to
         `Fail`.
    - If `nvswitch_expected` is true, `nvswitch` evidence is REQUIRED and
       `report_data.nvswitch_evidence_hash` must be present. Raw-byte hash
       equality is required for `nvswitch_binding=Pass`. Missing evidence,
       missing hash, malformed evidence, or invalid SPDM evidence is
       fail-closed. A hash mismatch caused by the known server-side JSON
       re-encoding bug is isolated to `nvswitch_binding`: teep verifies
       REPORTDATA using the reported hash value, sets `nvswitch_bound=false`
       in detail, and leaves `cpu_gpu_chain` able to pass when GPU evidence
       hash binding succeeds.
    - If `nvswitch_expected` is false (for example single-GPU systems or
       8-GPU Blackwell MPT systems),
       `nvswitch` may be absent.
    This prevents downgrade/omission ambiguity for GPU evidence.
5. Recompute the expected REPORTDATA:
   ```
   expected[0:32] = SHA-256(tls_key_fp || hpke_key || nonce || gpu_evidence_hash || nvswitch_evidence_hash)
   expected[32:64] = zeros
   ```
   Where `nvswitch_evidence_hash` contributes zero bytes (empty concatenation)
   when `nvswitch` is absent.
6. Constant-time compare against the CPU quote's actual REPORTDATA.
7. Verify each GPU evidence SPDM report (nonce matches client nonce,
   certificate chain validates against NVIDIA root).
8. If `nvswitch_expected` is true, verify NVSwitch evidence and fail closed
   on missing/invalid evidence. If only the raw JSON bytes fail to hash to the
   reported value, preserve REPORTDATA verification with the reported hash and
   fail `nvswitch_binding` with a server-side JSON re-encoding detail. If
   `nvswitch_expected` is false, NVSwitch verification is not required.

This gives both `tinfoil_v3_cloud` and `tinfoil_v3_direct` three properties:
- **GPU attestation binding**: GPU evidence hash is hardware-authenticated via CPU quote REPORTDATA.
- **Client nonce freshness**: Nonce in REPORTDATA proves attestation is fresh.
- **NVSwitch topology**: NVSwitch evidence validates the 8-GPU Hopper interconnect when required.

With the NVSwitch workaround active, factor behavior is:
- `tee_reportdata_binding`: `Pass` when the REPORTDATA hash verifies using
  the reported NVSwitch hash; detail includes `nvswitch_bound=false`.
- `cpu_gpu_chain`: `Pass` when `GPUHashBound=true`, because GPU evidence,
  TLS SPKI, HPKE key, and nonce are still authenticated by REPORTDATA.
- `nvswitch_binding`: `Fail` when `NVSwitchExpected=true` and
  `NVSwitchHashBound=false`, with detail identifying the server-side JSON
  re-encoding mismatch.

### Attestation Freshness

Both Tinfoil providers use client-supplied nonces:

1. Client generates a random 32-byte nonce and appends `?nonce=<64hex>` to the
   attestation URL. The nonce is required — if omitted, the server may return
   a legacy format response; the attester MUST reject any response without a
   `report_data` structured field.
2. The nonce is included in the REPORTDATA hash, providing cryptographic
   freshness.
3. The nonce is also passed through to GPU SPDM reports for GPU freshness.

**What teep must enforce:**

- Always generate a random 32-byte nonce per attestation request (fail if empty).
- Include nonce as `?nonce=<64hex>` in the attestation URL.
- Reject any response that lacks the `report_data` structured field.
- Verify `report_data.nonce` equals the client nonce (constant-time compare).
- Verify the nonce is in the REPORTDATA hash (see REPORTDATA Verification above).
- The `nonce_in_reportdata` factor is `enforced`.
- An authorization miss requires fresh attestation with a fresh nonce.
  Teep checks the attestation fetch peer against `report_data.tls_key_fp` and
  enforces the authenticated SPKI during each new inference TLS handshake.
  Authorization replacement and TLS failures follow the shared
  [transport](../../transport/README.md) and [retry](../../transport/retries.md)
  contracts.

### Alternate Authentication Chain: ATC Attestation Bundle (Legacy V2 Bootstrap)

Tinfoil's client applications use a public **Attestation Transparency Cache
(ATC)** service that bundles hardware attestation evidence with supply-chain
artifacts. The cache is not a verifier — clients fetch the bundle and verify
every link independently. This sub-section documents what ATC serves, how
clients use it, and the freshness/expiry guarantees that apply.

**Teep should not implement usage of the ATC** - the ATC currently uses the legacy
V2 attestation protocol which does not ensure freshness. It is documented here
for reference only.

#### What ATC Serves

**Endpoint**: `https://atc.tinfoil.sh/attestation` (or custom `attestationBundleURL`)

**Request format (for default router bundle)**:
```
GET /attestation
```

**Request format (for specific enclave or repo)**:
```
POST /attestation
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "enclaveUrl": "https://gemma4-31b-1.inf10.tinfoil.sh",
  "repo": "tinfoilsh/confidential-gemma4-31b"
}
```

Both `enclaveUrl` and `repo` are optional in the POST body; ATC routes to
the default router if neither is specified.

**Response format** (both GET and POST):
```json
{
  "domain": "<e.g., inference.tinfoil.sh or gemma4-31b-1.inf10.tinfoil.sh>",
  "enclaveAttestationReport": {
    "format": "https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/sev-snp-guest/v2",
    "body": "<base64+gzip raw binary SEV-SNP attestation report>"
  },
  "digest": "<SHA-256 hex of code image>",
  "sigstoreBundle": { ... },
  "vcek": "<base64 AMD VCEK certificate in DER>",
  "enclaveCert": "<PEM-encoded TLS leaf certificate>"
}
```

**What's in the bundle:**

| Field | Content | Authenticated by |
|---|---|---|
| `domain` | Target enclave hostname | REPORTDATA (V2: TLS FP at bytes 0–31) |
| `enclaveAttestationReport` | V2-format gzip+base64 SEV-SNP attestation report | Hardware-signed AMD VCEK signature |
| `digest` | Git commit SHA-256 of code image | Sigstore bundle |
| `sigstoreBundle` | In-toto DSSE bundle: code measurement predicates | Sigstore root of trust (Fulcio + Rekor) |
| `vcek` | AMD VCEK cert chain (SEV-SNP) | AMD root of trust |
| `enclaveCert` | TLS leaf certificate containing HPKE key and attestation hash in SANs | Cross-checked against hardware quote |

**ATC is a cache, not a verifier:**

ATC does not perform attestation verification. It assembles the bundle by
fetching the raw attestation from the enclave endpoint
(`/.well-known/tinfoil-attestation`, **no nonce parameter**), fetching the
corresponding Sigstore bundle from GitHub Releases, and fetching the VCEK
certificate from AMD KDS. Clients fetch from ATC and verify each component
independently.

#### ATC Attestation Format: V2, Not V3

ATC bundles use the **V2 attestation format** — the legacy format predating
client nonces. The key difference from the V3 format used by teep:

| Property | V2 (ATC bundles) | V3 (teep direct fetch) |
|---|---|---|
| Nonce | None — no `?nonce=` parameter sent to enclave | Client-supplied 32-byte nonce |
| REPORTDATA layout | `[0:32]` = TLS FP, `[32:64]` = HPKE key (directly) | `[0:32]` = SHA-256(TLS FP \|\| HPKE \|\| nonce \|\| GPU hashes), `[32:64]` = zeros |
| HPKE key extraction | Read directly from REPORTDATA bytes 32–63 | Read from `report_data.hpke_key` JSON field (authenticated by hash) |
| GPU evidence | Not included | Included and hash-bound into REPORTDATA |
| Freshness guarantee | None from nonce; relies on HTTPS+cert SANs | Client nonce bound into hardware quote |
| Format URI | `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/sev-snp-guest/v2` | `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/attestation/v3` |

The V2 `REPORTDATA` layout was defined in `BodyV2` in the cvmimage codebase:
`REPORTDATA[0:32] = TLS_KEY_FP`, `REPORTDATA[32:64] = HPKE_KEY`. The JS
verifier (`attestation.ts`) extracts these directly:
```typescript
const tlsKeyFp = bytesToHex(keys.slice(0, 32));
const hpkePublicKey = bytesToHex(keys.slice(32, 64));
```

**HPKE key authentication in V2 bundles** uses a dual mechanism:
1. The HPKE key is embedded directly in REPORTDATA bytes 32–63, which are
   part of the hardware-signed AMD VCEK quote — hardware-authenticated.
2. The TLS leaf certificate (`enclaveCert`) encodes the same HPKE key in its
   Subject Alternative Name (SAN) DNS entries using a `.hpke.` label scheme.
   It also encodes `SHA-256(format + body)` of the attestation document in
   `.hatt.` SANs. The `cert-verify.ts` verifier cross-checks both:
   - Decodes the HPKE key from the `.hpke.` SANs and compares it to the key
     extracted from REPORTDATA.
   - Decodes the attestation hash from the `.hatt.` SANs and verifies it
     matches a freshly-computed hash of the `enclaveAttestationReport`.

This dual binding means the HPKE key is authenticated both by the hardware
quote (REPORTDATA) and by the TLS certificate (SANs), with the TLS fingerprint
itself also embedded in REPORTDATA bytes 0–31.

#### How Clients Use ATC

Both clients use ATC to bootstrap attestation. Each call to `SecureClient`
specifies which enclave to verify; the HPKE key returned belongs to **that
specific enclave**, not necessarily the router.

**Webapp client** (tinfoil-js SDK):

The webapp creates multiple `SecureClient` instances for different enclaves:

| Service | `enclaveURL` | `configRepo` | EHBP key is for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main chat | *(none — default)* | `tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router` | **Router** HPKE key |
| Summarizer | `https://summarizer.tinfoil.sh` | `tinfoilsh/confidential-summarizer` | **Summarizer enclave** HPKE key |
| Metadata | `https://opengraph-metadata.tinfoil.sh` | `tinfoilsh/confidential-website-metadata-fetcher` | **Metadata enclave** HPKE key |

Main chat (`tinfoil-client.ts`):
```typescript
secureClient = new SecureClient({});  // No options → default router
await secureClient.ready();  // POST /attestation with { repo: "tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router" }
// EHBP key = router's HPKE key from REPORTDATA[32:64]
```

Specific enclave (`metadata-client.ts`, `summary-client.ts`):
```typescript
new SecureClient({
  enclaveURL: 'https://summarizer.tinfoil.sh',
  configRepo: 'tinfoilsh/confidential-summarizer',
})
// POST /attestation with { enclaveUrl: "...", repo: "..." }
// EHBP key = summarizer enclave's own HPKE key from REPORTDATA[32:64]
```

**iOS client** (tinfoil-swift SDK):

| Service | `enclaveURL` | `githubRepo` | EHBP key is for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main chat | *(none — default)* | `tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router` | **Router** HPKE key |
| Summarizer | `https://summarizer.tinfoil.sh` | *(from Constants)* | **Summarizer enclave** HPKE key |
| Document conversion | `https://doc-upload.tinfoil.sh` | *(from Constants)* | **Doc-upload enclave** HPKE key |

Main chat (`ChatViewModel.swift`):
```swift
client = try await TinfoilAI.create(apiKey: apiKey)
// Defaults: githubRepo = "tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router"
// ATC returns router bundle; EHBP to router's HPKE key
```

Specific enclave (`SummarizerService.swift`):
```swift
let newClient = SecureClient(
  githubRepo: Constants.Summarizer.githubRepo,
  enclaveURL: Constants.Summarizer.enclaveURL
)
// ATC returns summarizer-specific bundle; EHBP to summarizer's HPKE key
```

**Key point on EHBP key scope:** When a client fetches a specific enclave's
bundle from ATC (via POST with `enclaveUrl`), it authenticates and EHBP-encrypts
to **that enclave's own HPKE key** — not the router's. This is the EHBP equivalent
of `tinfoil_v3_direct` in teep. The main chat flow (no `enclaveURL`) uses the
router's key, analogous to `tinfoil_v3_cloud`.

**Teep client**:

Teep does NOT use ATC:

- For `tinfoil_v3_cloud`: Teep directly fetches V3 attestation from the router
  with a client-supplied nonce. EHBP encrypts to the router's HPKE key.
- For `tinfoil_v3_direct`: Teep directly fetches V3 attestation from per-model
  inference enclaves with a client-supplied nonce. EHBP encrypts to that
  model enclave's own HPKE key.

Teep uses V3 format (not V2) providing: nonce-bound freshness, GPU evidence
binding in REPORTDATA, and structured JSON attestation parsing. Teep does not
depend on the TLS certificate SAN authentication mechanism because V3
REPORTDATA hash provides equivalent binding without relying on the certificate.

#### Freshness Properties

**Hardware attestation freshness via ATC (V2 bundles — no client nonce):**

ATC fetches from `/.well-known/tinfoil-attestation` **without** a `?nonce=`
parameter. The returned V2 attestation report has no client-supplied nonce
bound into REPORTDATA. Freshness is not enforced by a nonce; the bundle may
represent a cached attestation of any age.

The V2 HPKE/TLS binding is still hardware-authenticated (the AMD VCEK private
key signs the REPORTDATA bytes), but the binding proves only that *a* router
with those keys was genuine at *some* point — not that the attestation was
fresh at the moment the client fetched it. Clients using ATC rely on:
- HTTPS transport to ATC for integrity in transit.
- TLS certificate SAN binding (`.hatt.` hash = SHA-256 of attestation document)
  to confirm that the `enclaveCert` and the `enclaveAttestationReport` refer
  to the same attestation event.
- TLS connection to the enclave itself (implicit "is the server still alive"
  check) for liveness — but not for key freshness.

**Hardware attestation freshness via direct V3 fetch (teep):**

Client supplies a random 32-byte nonce as `?nonce=<64hex>`. The nonce is
included in the V3 hardware quote's REPORTDATA[0:32] hash:
```
REPORTDATA[0:32] = SHA-256(tls_fp || hpke_key || nonce || gpu_hash || nvswitch_hash)
```
This provides cryptographic proof that the attestation was generated *after*
the client chose the nonce. Replay attacks are detected via nonce mismatch.
This freshness model is strictly stronger than the V2/ATC model and is what
teep enforces for both providers.

**Bundle cache expiry (ATC TTL):**

ATC bundles are not cached with an explicit TTL; the service fetches from the
enclave on demand each time a client requests a bundle. If a client fetches
a new bundle later, it receives a fresh attestation report (though still
without a client nonce). A cached bundle's age is bounded only by the client's
re-attestation policy.

**V2 nonce absence — implications:**

- The V2 attestation report's REPORTDATA bytes are hardware-signed but
  contain no nonce. An attacker who captured a valid V2 bundle and held it
  could replay it to a client if the enclave TLS certificate and HPKE key
  have not rotated since.
- The `.hatt.` SAN in `enclaveCert` binds the certificate to a specific
  attestation document (by hash), preventing the certificate from being
  paired with a different (forged) attestation. But it does not prevent
  replaying both the certificate and the original attestation together.
- This is an accepted design tradeoff in the Tinfoil SDK (ATC is primarily
  a convenience cache for browser/mobile clients that cannot implement nonce
  generation easily). Teep uses the stricter V3 path.

**Rekeying and re-attestation (ATC clients):**

When the enclave rotates its TLS certificate or HPKE key, ATC will serve a
new bundle containing the updated attestation report and certificate. Clients
detect this on first connection when the TLS fingerprint from the new bundle
does not match the server's certificate. Both the JS SDK (`KeyConfigMismatchError`
recovery) and the Swift SDK implement re-verification on key mismatch.

#### Client Coverage

Both production Tinfoil clients (webapp and iOS) use ATC. The EHBP key each
client authenticates depends on which enclave the `SecureClient` is created for:

| Client | Use case | Target enclave | EHBP key scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Webapp (`tinfoil-client.ts`) | Main chat | Router (default) | Router HPKE key |
| Webapp (`summary-client.ts`) | Summarization | `summarizer.tinfoil.sh` | Summarizer HPKE key |
| Webapp (`metadata-client.ts`) | Link metadata | `opengraph-metadata.tinfoil.sh` | Metadata enclave HPKE key |
| iOS (`ChatViewModel.swift`) | Main chat | Router (default) | Router HPKE key |
| iOS (`SummarizerService.swift`) | Summarization | `summarizer.tinfoil.sh` | Summarizer HPKE key |
| iOS (`DocumentConversionService.swift`) | Document upload | `doc-upload.tinfoil.sh` | Doc-upload HPKE key |
| **Teep** (`tinfoil_v3_cloud`) | Chat via router | Router (V3 direct) | Router HPKE key |
| **Teep** (`tinfoil_v3_direct`) | Chat direct | Per-model enclave (V3 direct) | Model enclave HPKE key |

## Protocol Descriptions

### Tinfoil Attestation Protocol

#### Attestation Document Format

The enclave serves its attestation at `GET /.well-known/tinfoil-attestation?nonce=<64hex>`.

The nonce parameter is **required** (32 bytes encoded as 64 lowercase hex chars, lowercase only).
Omitting the nonce may result in a legacy V2 format response (without `report_data` JSON field);
the attester must reject any response that lacks the `report_data` structured field (i.e., must reject V2 format).

**Key requirement**: The nonce must be a cryptographically random 32-byte value generated by the client.
Each attestation request must use a fresh nonce; reusing nonces defeats freshness guarantees.

**Response format (V3):**

```json
{
   "format": "https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/attestation/v3",
   "report_data": {
      "tls_key_fp": "<64 hex lowercase>",
      "hpke_key": "<64 hex lowercase>",
      "nonce": "<64 hex lowercase>",
      "gpu_evidence_hash": "<64 hex lowercase>",
      "nvswitch_evidence_hash": "<64 hex lowercase, absent/omitted if nvswitch_expected is false>"
   },
   "cpu": {
      "platform": "tdx|sev-snp",
      "report": "<base64-encoded raw binary attestation report>"
   },
   "gpu": {
      "evidences": [
         {
            "arch": "HOPPER|BLACKWELL|UNKNOWN_nnn",
            "certificate": "<base64 NVIDIA attestation cert chain>",
            "evidence": "<base64 SPDM attestation report>",
            "nonce": "<64 hex lowercase>"
         }
      ]
   },
   "nvswitch": {
      "evidences": [
         "<base64 NVSwitch attestation evidence>"
      ]
   },
   "certificate": "<PEM-encoded TLS leaf certificate>",
   "signature": "<base64-encoded ECDSA ASN.1 DER signature over SHA-256(json with signature field empty)>"
}
```

**Nested field details**:
- `gpu.evidences[].arch`: GPU architecture identifier (`HOPPER`, `BLACKWELL`, or `UNKNOWN_nnn` for unknown IDs)
- `gpu.evidences[].nonce`: Hex-encoded nonce (same value as `report_data.nonce`)
- `gpu.evidences[].evidence`: Raw binary SPDM report, base64-encoded
- `gpu.evidences[].certificate`: Attestation certificate chain, base64-encoded
- `nvswitch.evidences[]`: Per-NVSwitch attestation evidence, base64-encoded (only when `nvswitch_evidence_hash` is present)

**Format values**:
- Envelope format URI: exactly `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/attestation/v3`. Reject any other value.
- Hardware platform type: taken from `cpu.platform` (`tdx` or `sev-snp`, lowercase).
  Do not infer CPU platform from `format`; use the explicit `cpu.platform` field.

#### CPU Report

Base64-decode `cpu.report`. Bound the decoded size (10 MiB max) to prevent oversized attestation payload abuse. The result is a raw binary attestation report:
- For TDX (`cpu.platform == "tdx"`): Intel TDX QuoteV4 structure (typically 1020+ bytes)
- For SEV-SNP (`cpu.platform == "sev-snp"`): AMD SEV-SNP attestation report (1184 bytes)

If the decoded report size falls outside expected bounds for the detected platform, fail closed.

#### REPORTDATA Layout (64 bytes)

Both TDX and SEV-SNP reports contain a 64-byte `report_data` field (embedded in the binary attestation report, separate from the JSON `report_data` response field).

| Offset | Size | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 0–31 | 32 bytes | SHA-256(tls_key_fp \|\| hpke_key \|\| nonce \|\| gpu_evidence_hash \|\| nvswitch_evidence_hash) |
| 32–63 | 32 bytes | All zeros |

The hash input includes:
- `tls_key_fp`: 32 bytes from `report_data.tls_key_fp` (hex-decoded)
- `hpke_key`: 32 bytes from `report_data.hpke_key` (hex-decoded)
- `nonce`: 32 bytes from `report_data.nonce` (hex-decoded; same as query param nonce)
- `gpu_evidence_hash`: SHA-256 of raw `gpu` JSON field (32 bytes)
- `nvswitch_evidence_hash`: SHA-256 of raw `nvswitch` JSON field (32 bytes), or empty bytes (zero length) when `nvswitch` is absent

When `nvswitch` is absent, the hash concatenation is `tls_key_fp || hpke_key || nonce || gpu_evidence_hash` with no padding.

#### Envelope Integrity Verification

In addition to REPORTDATA verification, the envelope must be validated as
follows:

**Format downgrade prevention priority order** (steps 1–2 are never relaxed,
even if strict schema validation is loosened for forward compatibility):

1. Require `format` equals exactly `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/attestation/v3`.
   This is the authoritative format check. Reject any other value.
2. Reject any response with a `body` field (legacy V2 format indicator).
   This is the independent legacy-format guard.
3. Parse the full envelope with `internal/jsonstrict`. Current code records
   unknown and missing fields for the `response_schema` factor rather than
   rejecting solely on schema drift; required semantic fields are still
   validated explicitly before trust decisions.
4. Parse and validate `report_data.tls_key_fp`, `report_data.hpke_key`,
   `report_data.nonce`, and optional hash fields as hex strings that decode
   to exactly 32 bytes (64 hex chars).
5. Verify `report_data.nonce` equals the client nonce used in
   `?nonce=<hex>` (constant-time compare on decoded bytes).
6. Parse `certificate` as PEM and extract the leaf public key.
7. Verify leaf public key fingerprint equals `report_data.tls_key_fp`
   (constant-time). This binds the envelope signer key to REPORTDATA.
8. Verify attestation-envelope key/channel consistency:
   - Extract the live TLS peer leaf public key from the HTTPS connection used
     to fetch attestation.
   - Constant-time compare its SPKI fingerprint to `report_data.tls_key_fp`.
   - Fail closed on mismatch.
9. Validate envelope cross-field consistency before signature checks:
    - `gpu` field is REQUIRED by the V3 security model. Current code allows
       parsing to continue when it is absent so the verification report can
       fail GPU-related factors explicitly; enforced policy must still block
       when those factors are not in `allow_fail`.
    - If `gpu` field is present, `report_data.gpu_evidence_hash` must be
       present and equal `SHA-256(raw_gpu_json)`.
    - Determine `nvswitch_expected` with the normalization algorithm defined
      in "REPORTDATA Verification" above.
    - If `nvswitch_expected` is true, `nvswitch` field and
       `report_data.nvswitch_evidence_hash` are required. Matching raw bytes
       set `nvswitch_bound=true`; the known JSON re-encoding mismatch sets
       `nvswitch_bound=false`, verifies REPORTDATA with the reported hash, and
       fails only the `nvswitch_binding` factor.
    - If `nvswitch_expected` is false (including Blackwell B200/B300 MPT
       systems), `nvswitch` may be absent.
    - Verify all hex strings in `report_data` are exactly 64 characters when
      present (32 bytes).
10. Verify `signature` using ECDSA ASN.1 over SHA-256 of the JSON payload
   with the `signature` value replaced by an empty string.
   - **Preferred approach**: edit the raw JSON response bytes directly.
     Find the `"signature":"<base64>"` value in the raw bytes and replace
     the value with `""`, preserving all other bytes exactly. This avoids
     implementation-dependent JSON serialization differences between Go's
     `encoding/json` and the Tinfoil enclave's serializer (which may be a
     different language). Differences in field ordering, whitespace, unicode
     escaping, or number formatting between serializers would cause spurious
     signature verification failures.
   - **Alternative**: If Tinfoil documents an explicit serialization contract
     (e.g., RFC 8785 JCS or Go `encoding/json` struct-order guarantee), the
     parse-modify-reserialize approach is acceptable. Without such a contract,
     raw-byte surgery is the only safe approach.
   - Compute SHA-256 of the resulting JSON bytes (with signature zeroed).
   - Verify the base64-decoded `signature` field (DER ASN.1 ECDSA signature)
     against this hash using the leaf public key from `certificate`.
   - Reject non-ECDSA leaf public keys.
   - Decode `signature` from base64 and verify DER ASN.1 form.
11. If envelope signature verification fails, fail closed before any CPU/GPU
   evidence trust decisions.

Rationale: REPORTDATA hash authenticates key fields via CPU hardware
signature; envelope signature adds tamper evidence for the full structured
payload and avoids ambiguous parsing attacks.

### TDX Verification (Reuse Existing)

For TDX-format attestation (`cpu.platform == "tdx"`), hex-encode the decoded
binary `cpu.report` and call the
existing `attestation.VerifyTDXQuoteOffline()` / `attestation.VerifyTDXQuoteOnline()` (via
the `attestation.TDXVerifier` function type). Extract measurements:

- Register 0: MRTD (48 bytes hex)
- Register 1: RTMR0 (48 bytes hex)
- Register 2: RTMR1 (48 bytes hex)
- Register 3: RTMR2 (48 bytes hex)
- Register 4: RTMR3 (48 bytes hex) — must be all zeros

Additionally, preserve QE report-data binding verification in the quote
verification pipeline (do not accept quote-verification implementations that
skip this check).

#### TDX Additional Policy Checks (Tinfoil-Specific)

After the standard TDX quote verification, apply these additional checks:

1. **TD Attributes**: Must equal `0x0000001000000000` (SEPT_VE_DISABLE=1).
2. **XFAM**: Must equal `0xe702060000000000`.
3. **Minimum TEE TCB SVN**: Must be >= `0x03010200000000000000000000000000`.
4. **MR_SEAM**: Must be in the accepted firmware whitelist (see Measurement
   Policy section).
5. **MR_CONFIG_ID, MR_OWNER, MR_OWNER_CONFIG**: Must be all zeros.
6. **RTMR3**: Must be all zeros (96 hex chars of '0').

### SEV-SNP Verification (New)

For SEV-SNP-format attestation:

1. Parse the binary as an AMD SEV-SNP attestation report.
2. Fetch the VCEK certificate from AMD KDS (or cache). The AMD KDS can be
   accessed via the proxy at `kds-proxy.tinfoil.sh` or directly from AMD.
3. Verify the report signature against the VCEK cert chain (AMD Genoa root).
4. Validate guest policy:
   - SMT: true
   - Debug: false
   - SingleSocket: false
   - MinimumBuild: 21
   - MinimumVersion: 1.55
5. Validate TCB:
   - BlSpl >= 0x07
   - TeeSpl >= 0x00
   - SnpSpl >= 0x0e
   - UcodeSpl >= 0x48
6. Extract measurement: `report.Measurement` (single 48-byte hex register).

Teep verifies SEV-SNP reports with `google/go-sev-guest`, analogous to its
TDX verification path through `go-tdx-guest`.

### Supply Chain Verification (Sigstore)

Tinfoil's supply chain verification uses GitHub Actions build attestations
verified through Sigstore. Teep fetches release metadata, release hashes, and
GitHub attestations through `github-proxy.tinfoil.sh` instead of GitHub's
public endpoints, avoiding direct GitHub 403/rate-limit failures while keeping
the trust decision in local Sigstore verification.

#### Step 1: Fetch Component Digest

For a given configuration repo (e.g. `tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router`):

```
GET https://github-proxy.tinfoil.sh/repos/{repo}/releases/latest
```

Parse `tag_name` from the response. Then fetch the digest:

```
GET https://github-proxy.tinfoil.sh/{repo}/releases/download/{tag}/tinfoil.hash
```

Returns a plain-text SHA-256 hex digest.

The digest must be exactly 64 lowercase or uppercase hexadecimal characters.
Malformed, empty, oversized, or HTTP-error responses fail closed.

#### Step 2: Fetch Sigstore DSSE Bundle

```
GET https://github-proxy.tinfoil.sh/repos/{repo}/attestations/sha256:{digest}
```

Returns JSON with `attestations[0].bundle` containing a Sigstore DSSE
envelope.

#### Step 3: Verify Bundle

Verify the DSSE bundle using Sigstore's verification library:

- **OIDC issuer**: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- **Workflow identity**: enforce both repository and tag-ref binding. The
   certificate identity must match the exact repository under verification and
   a tagged workflow ref (no branch refs, no pull-request refs). Use an anchored
   regex built from `regexp.QuoteMeta(repo)`, for example:
   `^https://github.com/<repo>/\.github/workflows/[^@]+@refs/tags/[^/]+$`.
   If Tinfoil publishes workflow-path allowlists per repo, pin to those exact
   workflow files instead of wildcard matching.
- **Artifact digest**: Must match the `sha256:{digest}` from Step 1.
- **Require**: At least 1 signed certificate timestamp, 1 transparency log
  entry, 1 observer timestamp.

The proxy is only the fetch transport. Teep verifies the DSSE bundle with the
Sigstore trusted root and rejects branch refs, pull-request refs, repository
mismatches, missing transparency evidence, and digest mismatches.

#### Step 4: Extract Code Measurements

The verified DSSE bundle contains an in-toto statement with a predicate. The
predicate type determines the measurement format:

- **`https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/snp-tdx-multiplatform/v1`**: Three registers:
  - Register 0: `snp_measurement` (SEV-SNP launch measurement)
  - Register 1: `tdx_measurement.rtmr1` (TDX RTMR1)
  - Register 2: `tdx_measurement.rtmr2` (TDX RTMR2)

#### Step 5: Compare Code vs. Enclave Measurements

Cross-platform comparison logic:

**Multi-platform code vs. TDX enclave:**
- Compare code register 1 (RTMR1) == enclave register 2 (RTMR1).
- Compare code register 2 (RTMR2) == enclave register 3 (RTMR2).
- Verify enclave register 4 (RTMR3) is all zeros.

**Multi-platform code vs. SEV-SNP enclave:**
- Compare code register 0 (snp_measurement) == enclave register 0 (measurement).

All comparisons MUST be constant-time (`subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`).

#### Component Recognition and Signature Factors

Tinfoil supply-chain verification is reported through the generic component
factors shared with compose-based providers:

- `build_transparency_log`: passes only when the Sigstore DSSE bundle is
  fetched and verified with the required transparency evidence.
- `component_recognition`: recognizes the component repo under verification.
  `tinfoil_v3_cloud` records `tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router`;
  `tinfoil_v3_direct` records the per-model repo returned by
  `RepoForProvider`; TDX hardware-measurement validation records
  `tinfoilsh/hardware-measurements` when that registry is fetched. This factor
  is in the default `allow_fail` set.
- `provider_signer_recognition`: requires each signed component to be in the
  provider-wide trusted Tinfoil namespace (`tinfoilsh/*`) and to have a
  verified Sigstore bundle. Unknown signer namespaces fail closed.
- `component_signature_recognition`: requires each signed component to match
  its component-specific Sigstore policy. Unknown component repos or failed
  bundle verification fail closed.

The current recognized Tinfoil component set is
`tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router`, any `tinfoilsh/confidential-*`
per-model repo, and `tinfoilsh/hardware-measurements`.

### Hardware Measurement Verification (TDX Only)

For TDX enclaves, verify that the hardware platform (MRTD, RTMR0) matches a
known trusted platform:

1. Fetch latest hardware measurements from
   `tinfoilsh/hardware-measurements` repo via GitHub Releases + Sigstore
   (same flow as code measurements above).
2. The predicate type is
   `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/hardware-measurements/v1`.
3. The predicate is a JSON object mapping platform ID to `{ "mrtd": "...",
   "rtmr0": "..." }`; the platform ID is the map key.
4. Match the enclave's MRTD (register 0) and RTMR0 (register 1) against the
   hardware measurement entries.
5. If no match is found, the hardware platform is unknown — record as a
   verification factor failure.

### TLS Certificate Fingerprint Verification

After attestation verification:

1. Extract the TLS fingerprint from `report_data.tls_key_fp` (authenticated
   by REPORTDATA[0:32] hash).
2. The proxy already has the upstream TLS certificate (from the HTTP
   connection).
3. Compute SHA-256 of the certificate's PKIX-encoded public key.
4. Constant-time compare the computed fingerprint with the attested
   fingerprint.
5. On mismatch: fail closed.

This binding ensures the TLS connection terminates inside the attested enclave.

### TLS-Fingerprint Binding in Teep

Teep binds attestation and inference to the same cryptographic TLS identity:

1. During attestation fetch, `FetchAttestationWithTLS` records the live HTTPS
   peer SPKI. The attester compares it in constant time against the attested
   `report_data.tls_key_fp`.
2. Before sending inference bytes on each new TLS connection, the pinned
   transport requires TLS 1.3, WebPKI, Certificate Transparency, and a matching
   attested SPKI. TLS session resumption is disabled for these pools.

The proxy resolves a direct-provider route once, including its supply-chain
repository. It publishes the report, route authority, transport identity, and
EHBP key as one authorization generation. Evidence expiration alone does not
trigger renewal; discovery metadata refreshes
and local cache timers do not extend or shorten that cryptographic lifetime.

Cloud models on the same router authority share one verified authorization and
key generation. Full router attestation is performed once on a cache miss,
including concurrent misses across models. Reports retain the requested model
and its own E2EE roundtrip outcome. A key rejection invalidates only the shared
router generation used by that request. Direct mode retains model-and-authority
scopes because it verifies the backend evidence and repository for that route.

See [authorization validity and cached report selection](../../transport/README.md#routes-and-authorizations)
for the authenticated certificate bounds and exact-authority report lookup.

Pools are scoped to provider, authority, and attested SPKI. Equal identities
reuse HTTP/2 connections and multiplex requests. A changed key replaces the
selectable pool and closes its idle connections. A trust or demonstrated key
failure invalidates only the authorization generation used by that request.
Every request and permitted retry creates a fresh EHBP session. At most one
retry is allowed, only for a typed pre-connection failure or the exact documented
key-rejection response. Redirects, ambiguous failures, and response decryption
failures are not retried. Buffered inference requests have no `GetBody` callback.

No `Connection: close` or `Connection: keep-alive` header is set. Socket limits
apply per transport pool and dial address, not across all pools for an
authority. Separate provider pools and overlapping pools during SPKI rotation
can exceed one pool's limit. See the shared
[connection limits and setup budgets](../../transport/README.md#connection-reuse-and-resource-limits)
for the current settings and their interaction with HTTP/2 accounting.

### E2EE: Encrypted HTTP Body Protocol (EHBP)

EHBP is documented at https://docs.tinfoil.sh/resources/ehbp and specified at
https://github.com/tinfoilsh/encrypted-http-body-protocol/blob/main/SPEC.md

The protocol encrypts entire HTTP request and response bodies using HPKE
(RFC 9180) while leaving headers in cleartext for routing.

Key discovery/source in teep integration:
- The encryption key is the attested HPKE key from the V3 envelope hash chain
   (`report_data.hpke_key`, authenticated by REPORTDATA[0:32] hash), not an
   unauthenticated key-discovery endpoint.

Compatibility rule: for Tinfoil, apply EHBP behavior consistently across
`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/embeddings`, and
`/v1/audio/speech` when provider E2EE is enabled. The current proxy rejects
`/v1/audio/transcriptions` when E2EE is enabled because multipart uploads are
not implemented through EHBP; with provider E2EE disabled, the same route can
be forwarded over attested, SPKI-pinned TLS. `/v1/convert/file` is deferred
to `tinfoil_endpoints.md`.

**Mode rule (mandatory)**:
- If provider E2EE is enabled and the registered route supports Tinfoil EHBP:
   request body MUST be EHBP-encrypted, must include `Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key`,
   and encrypted response MUST include `Ehbp-Response-Nonce`.
- If provider E2EE is disabled, the route is forwarded in plaintext over the
   TLS-bound upstream path after attestation.
- If request is bodyless by method/endpoint contract (for example
   GET/HEAD/DELETE/OPTIONS such as `/v1/models`): request is plaintext,
   response is plaintext, and EHBP headers MUST be absent.
- Empty-body POST/PUT/PATCH requests are not a plaintext fallback path. If an
   endpoint expects a request body, an empty body MUST be rejected fail-closed.
- Never downgrade an encrypted exchange to plaintext on missing/invalid EHBP
   headers; fail closed.
- WebSocket `/v1/realtime` is outside EHBP scope (deferred to
  `tinfoil_endpoints.md`).

#### HPKE Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| KEM | X25519_HKDF_SHA256 (0x0020) |
| KDF | HKDF_SHA256 (0x0001) |
| AEAD | AES_256_GCM (0x0002) |

#### Request Encryption

1. Use the HPKE public key from the verified attestation (extracted from
   `report_data.hpke_key`, verified via REPORTDATA[0:32] hash).
   The cipher suite is hardcoded:
   X25519_HKDF_SHA256 / HKDF_SHA256 / AES_256_GCM.
2. Establish an HPKE encryption context (`SetupBaseS`) using the server's
   public key and a fresh ephemeral keypair.
3. Encrypt the request body as a stream of length-prefixed chunks:
   - Each chunk: `[4-byte big-endian uint32 length] [AES-256-GCM ciphertext]`
   - Length counts ciphertext bytes only (not the 4-byte header).
   - AAD is empty. The HPKE sealer's internal nonce counter auto-increments.
   - Zero-length ciphertext chunks are not valid encrypted EHBP chunks in the
     current teep reader; they fail AEAD authentication.
   - End of message is indicated by HTTP stream termination (no sentinel).
   - **Maximum chunk size: 16 MiB** (16 * 1024 * 1024 bytes). Reject chunk
     length prefixes above this bound before allocating buffers. The 4-byte
     uint32 length allows up to ~4 GiB; without a bound, a malicious server
     can trigger 4 GiB allocation before AEAD verification. 16 MiB is
     sufficient for any inference response chunk.
4. Set request header `Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key` to the lowercase hex encoding
   of the HPKE encapsulated key (32 bytes → 64 hex chars for X25519).
5. Send encrypted bodies with unknown length (`Content-Length` unset/unknown).
   - HTTP/1.1: use chunked entity-body framing.
   - HTTP/2: rely on DATA frames with END_STREAM semantics (do not force
     `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, which is HTTP/1.1-specific).
6. Preserve the original request `Content-Type` header exactly (including
   multipart boundary parameters) when forwarding encrypted requests. Do not
   overwrite `Content-Type` to `application/octet-stream` on paths where the
   upstream expects semantic media types.
7. Retain the HPKE sender context for response decryption.

#### Response Decryption

1. Read the `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` header (lowercase hex, 64 chars = 32 bytes).
   If absent, fail closed — do not treat the response as authenticated.
2. Derive response keys (following OHTTP / RFC 9458):
   ```
   secret = context.Export("ehbp response", 32)
   salt = concat(encapsulated_key, response_nonce)
   prk = HKDF-Extract(salt, secret)
   aead_key = HKDF-Expand(prk, "key", 32)    // AES-256 key
   aead_nonce = HKDF-Expand(prk, "nonce", 12) // GCM nonce
   ```
3. Decrypt response body chunks:
   - Same framing as request: `[4-byte length] [ciphertext]`.
   - Each chunk decrypted with AES-256-GCM using `aead_key`.
   - Nonce for chunk `i` (zero-indexed): `aead_nonce XOR i`, where `i` is a
     uint64 counter XORed into the low 8 bytes of the 12-byte `aead_nonce`.
   - **Maximum chunk count: 2^31.** AES-GCM has a hard 2^32 invocation limit
     with the same key before nonce reuse enables the "forbidden attack"
     (AEAD forgery + plaintext recovery). Fail closed if the chunk counter
     exceeds 2^31 (conservative bound with safety margin).
   - AAD is empty.
   - Reject chunk lengths above 16 MiB before allocation.
4. On any decryption failure: fail closed, abort the response.

Response mode detection:
- If request body was encrypted, `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` is REQUIRED and the
   response body is encrypted.
- If request was bodyless by method/endpoint contract,
   `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` MUST be absent and the response body is plaintext.
- Any mismatch (encrypted request with missing/invalid nonce, or bodyless
   request with unexpected nonce) is a protocol failure; fail closed.

#### EHBP Header Validation

1. `Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key` must decode as exactly 32 bytes for X25519 KEM.
2. `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` must decode as exactly 32 bytes.
3. Invalid hex, wrong length, or unexpected header presence/absence is a
   protocol error and must fail closed.
4. Multiple instances of `Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key` or `Ehbp-Response-Nonce`
   headers in a single message are malformed input and must fail closed.
5. For encrypted requests where server returns plaintext error JSON without
   `Ehbp-Response-Nonce`, treat as unauthenticated diagnostic only and fail the
   request.
6. Recommended server-side error mapping (for compatibility with EHBP
    implementations):
    - `400 Bad Request`: malformed encapsulated key, framing, or AEAD failure
       attributable to request input.
    - `422 Unprocessable Entity`: key-configuration mismatch (for example,
       stale client key after rotation).
    - `500 Internal Server Error`: server-side failure not attributable to
       request cryptographic input.

#### API-Specific EHBP Handling Rules

1. `/v1/responses` follows the same EHBP behavior as `/v1/chat/completions`:
   full request-body encryption and full response-body authentication.
2. Multipart audio uploads (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`) are currently not
   supported in Tinfoil E2EE mode. The proxy rejects this route when Tinfoil E2EE is enabled.
3. For streaming endpoints (chat or responses), decrypt chunk stream before SSE
   parsing, and fail closed on any chunk authentication failure.
4. For bodyless GET `/v1/models`, do not send EHBP headers and do not expect
   EHBP response headers.
5. `/v1/convert/file` and `/v1/realtime` EHBP rules are in `tinfoil_endpoints.md`.

#### Bodyless Requests (GET /v1/models)

EHBP does not encrypt responses for bodyless requests (GET, HEAD, DELETE,
OPTIONS without a body). The `/v1/models` endpoint is a GET request, so it
is not EHBP-encrypted. In teep it is a proxy-aggregated model-list endpoint:
provider catalogs are fetched over normal HTTPS and model IDs are rewritten to
`provider:upstreamID`. It does not perform per-model attestation and is
treated as non-sensitive model metadata.

#### Audio Transcription (Multipart)

For `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, the request body is `multipart/form-data`.
Current teep behavior is:
- When provider E2EE is disabled, teep rewrites only the multipart `model`
  field to the upstream model ID and forwards the body over attested,
  SPKI-pinned TLS.
- When provider E2EE is enabled for either Tinfoil provider, teep rejects the
  request with a fail-closed diagnostic because multipart uploads are not
  implemented through EHBP.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Attestation Document Parsing and Verification

Teep fetches and verifies Tinfoil V3 attestation documents for both supported
CPU platforms and applies REPORTDATA verification before inference traffic is
allowed.

**Core files**:
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/tinfoil.go` — Shared types, constants, Preparer
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/attestation.go` — Attestation document parsing
  (V3 structured JSON, CPU report dispatch, TDX/SEV-SNP helpers)
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/attester.go` — `NewAttester`: V3 fetch (with
  nonce), structured JSON parsing, HPKE key from response field
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/verify.go` — `ReportDataVerifier` (SHA-256
  hash recomputation, GPU evidence hash verification) and TDX additional
  policy checks + MR_SEAM whitelist. These are combined into a single file
  because both are applied together in the same attestation verification pass.
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/resolver.go` — Direct-provider model-to-backend
  discovery via `/.well-known/tinfoil-proxy`.

**Note on nonce handling**: The attester uses the existing
`attestation.NewNonce()` and `nonce.Hex()` from `internal/attestation/attestation.go`
rather than raw byte manipulation. The `Nonce` type encapsulates
32-byte generation, hex encoding, and parsing.

**Note on resolver reuse**: The `tinfoil_v3_direct` model-to-domain resolver
uses the same concurrency shape as other provider resolvers: mutex-protected
cache, 5-minute TTL, and `singleflight` to collapse concurrent refreshes.

**Implementation**:

1. **Shared types** (`tinfoil.go`):
   - Accepted envelope format URI: `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/attestation/v3`.
   - CPU platform values: `tdx`, `sev-snp`.
   - Common `Preparer` (sets API key header).
   - Use existing `attestation.FormatTinfoil` backend format constant
     (defined in `internal/attestation/attestation.go`).

2. **Attestation parsing** (`attestation.go`):
   - `parseV3Response(body []byte)` parses V3 JSON with
     `internal/jsonstrict.UnmarshalWarn`, rejects legacy `body` responses,
     validates the exact format URI, validates required 32-byte hex fields,
     stores raw GPU/NVSwitch `json.RawMessage` bytes for hashing, decodes the
     bounded CPU report, and dispatches by `cpu.platform`.
   - For TDX, it hex-encodes the decoded report into `raw.IntelQuote`.
     For SEV-SNP, it stores decoded report bytes in `raw.SEVReportBytes`.
     Unknown platform values fail closed.

3. **Attester** (`attester.go`, `tinfoil.NewAttester(baseURL, apiKey, offline)`):
   - `FetchAttestation(ctx, model, nonce)` fetches
     `GET {baseURL}/.well-known/tinfoil-attestation?nonce=<hex>`
     (32 bytes → 64 hex chars). Nonce is required — fail if empty.
   - Parse the structured JSON response. Reject responses with a `body` field
     (legacy format indicator) or wrong `format` URI.
   - Base64-decode `cpu.report`, bound size to 10 MiB.
   - Dispatch CPU report parsing from `cpu.platform` and call the V3 CPU parser.
   - Extract `tls_key_fp` and `hpke_key` from `report_data` fields.
   - Verify `report_data.nonce` equals client nonce (constant-time).
   - Perform envelope signature verification (see Envelope Integrity
     Verification section).
   - Store GPU evidence raw JSON for REPORTDATA verification.
   - Store HPKE key via `raw.SigningKey` (hex-encoded).
   - Set `raw.BackendFormat = attestation.FormatTinfoil`.
   - Store the nonce in RawAttestation for report building.

4. **REPORTDATA Verifier** (`verify.go`, `tinfoil.ReportDataVerifier{}`):
   - `VerifyReportData(reportData [64]byte, raw, nonce)`:
     - Retrieve raw GPU JSON from raw attestation.
     - Retrieve raw NVSwitch JSON (may be empty) from raw attestation.
     - Recompute `gpu_evidence_hash = SHA-256(raw_gpu_json)`.
     - Determine `nvswitch_expected` using the normalization algorithm.
     - Compute/validate `nvswitch_evidence_hash` when required. If the raw
       NVSwitch JSON hash mismatches the reported hash, teep records
       `nvswitch_bound=false` but verifies REPORTDATA with the reported hash
       so the TLS, HPKE, nonce, and GPU-hash binding remain authenticated.
     - Recompute `expected[0:32] = SHA-256(tls_fp || hpke_key || nonce || gpu_hash || nvswitch_hash)`.
     - Constant-time compare `expected[0:32]` against `reportData[0:32]`.
     - Verify `reportData[32:64]` is all zeros.
     - Fail closed on any mismatch.
     - Return detail string: `"v3: reportdata_hash verified, nonce_bound=true, gpu_bound=true"`.
   - The `nonce_in_reportdata` factor is `enforced`.

5. **Tinfoil TDX Policy** (`verify.go`, applies to TDX attestations):
   - After standard TDX verification, apply Tinfoil-specific policy:
     - Validate TD_ATTRIBUTES == `0x0000001000000000`.
     - Validate XFAM == `0xe702060000000000`.
     - Validate MR_SEAM against the merged measurement policy.
     - Validate MR_CONFIG_ID, MR_OWNER, MR_OWNER_CONFIG are all zeros.
     - Validate RTMR3 is all zeros.
     - Validate TEE_TCB_SVN >= minimum.
   - Store results as `tee_hardware_config` factor details in the report.

6. **MR_SEAM and hardware measurements**:
   - MR_SEAM is checked against the merged measurement policy. Tinfoil's
     default policy reuses the base TDX MR_SEAM allowlist from
     `attestation.DstackBaseMeasurementPolicy()`, and config can extend or
     override measurement policy through the normal provider policy path.
   - The Sigstore hardware-measurements registry
     (`tinfoilsh/hardware-measurements`) is used for TDX hardware-platform
     matching of MRTD + RTMR0, reported through `tee_boot_config`; it is not
     the current source of the MR_SEAM allowlist.
   - In `--offline` mode, network-dependent Sigstore and KDS/PCS checks are
     skipped or reported according to existing factor policy; offline mode is
     an explicit user choice, not a connectivity fallback.

**Unit tests**:
- Test V3 document parsing with captured attestation response.
- Test attester rejects responses with `body` field (legacy format indicator).
- Test attester rejects wrong envelope format URI.
- Test attester rejects mismatched `report_data.nonce`.
- Test attester rejects invalid envelope signatures and cert/tls_key_fp mismatches.
- Test REPORTDATA verification: recompute SHA-256 hash, compare constant-time.
  Verify zeros in [32:64].
- Test GPU evidence hash computation (raw JSON bytes, not re-encoded).
- Test NVSwitch normalization: all branches (Hopper 8-GPU, Blackwell, single-GPU,
  malformed gpu.evidences).
- Test nonce required (empty nonce → error).
- Test TDX additional policy checks: valid, TD_ATTRIBUTES mismatch, XFAM
  mismatch, bad MR_SEAM, non-zero RTMR3.
- Test CPU report bounds check (oversized >10 MiB).
- Test format URI rejection (unknown URI, wrong platform value).
- Test `DefaultMeasurementPolicy` exposes the base TDX MR_SEAM allowlist and
  does not set MRTD allowlist entries.
- Test hardware-measurements registry fetch/verification/parsing failures are
  reflected in Sigstore component and `tee_boot_config` factors.

### Supply Chain Verification (Sigstore)

Teep verifies Tinfoil code measurements via Sigstore DSSE bundles from GitHub
Releases fetched through `github-proxy.tinfoil.sh`.

**Core files**:
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/sigstore.go` — Sigstore bundle fetching and
  verification
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/measurements.go` — Measurement comparison logic

**Implementation**:

1. **GitHub Release Fetcher**:
   - Fetch latest release tag through `github-proxy.tinfoil.sh`.
   - Fetch `tinfoil.hash` artifact from the release.
   - Fetch Sigstore attestation bundle from
     `repos/{repo}/attestations/sha256:{digest}`.

2. **Sigstore Bundle Verifier**:
   - Use the `sigstore-go` library to verify the DSSE bundle. This is a new
     dependency for Tinfoil bundle verification; teep's existing
     `internal/attestation/sigstore.go` and `internal/attestation/rekor.go`
     do not use `sigstore-go` and should only be referenced for reusable
     Rekor/Sigstore validation patterns. The `RekorClient` struct (with
     `NewRekorClient`, `NewRekorClientWithKey` constructors) manages Rekor
     interactions and public key validation without globals.
   - Certificate identity: OIDC issuer =
     `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`.
    - Workflow identity: enforce repository and tag-ref binding with an anchored
       pattern built from `regexp.QuoteMeta(repo)`, e.g.
       `^https://github.com/<repo>/\.github/workflows/[^@]+@refs/tags/[^/]+$`.
       Reject branch refs, pull-request refs, and repository mismatches.
   - Require SCT, transparency log entry, observer timestamp.
   - Extract the in-toto predicate after verification.

3. **Code Measurement Extraction**:
   - Parse predicateType from the verified statement.
   - For `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/snp-tdx-multiplatform/v1`:
     Extract `snp_measurement`, `tdx_measurement.rtmr1`,
     `tdx_measurement.rtmr2` as 3-register measurement.

4. **Hardware Measurement Fetcher** (TDX only):
   - Same GitHub + Sigstore flow, but for repo
     `tinfoilsh/hardware-measurements`.
   - Predicate type: `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/hardware-measurements/v1`.
   - Extract the platform-ID keyed object map whose values contain `mrtd` and
     `rtmr0`.
   - Match enclave's MRTD (register 0) and RTMR0 (register 1) against map
     values.

5. **Measurement Comparison**:
   - Implement cross-platform comparison:
     - Multi-platform vs. TDX: compare RTMR1 and RTMR2; verify RTMR3 == 0.
     - Multi-platform vs. SEV-SNP: compare snp_measurement.
   - All comparisons constant-time.
   - Record code match as `sigstore_code_verified` factor.
   - Record hardware-measurement match as `tee_boot_config` detail (not `cpu_id_registry`).

6. **Configuration Repo Mapping**:
   - `tinfoil_v3_cloud` uses the static router repo
     `tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router`.
   - `tinfoil_v3_direct` records the per-model repo returned by
     `/.well-known/tinfoil-proxy` on `RawAttestation.TinfoilRepo`; report
     helpers use the same resolver and only fall back to `RepoForModel` if
     discovery is unavailable.

**Unit tests**:
- Test Sigstore bundle verification with a captured bundle (testdata).
- Test measurement extraction for multi-platform predicate.
- Test cross-platform comparison: TDX match, TDX mismatch, SEV-SNP match.
- Test hardware measurement matching: found, not found.
- Test RTMR3 zero validation.

### SEV-SNP Attestation Verification

Teep supports Tinfoil enclaves running on AMD SEV-SNP.

**Core files**:
- `internal/attestation/sev.go` — SEV-SNP report parsing and verification
- `internal/attestation/sev_test.go` — Unit tests

**Implementation**:

1. **Use `google/go-sev-guest`** (analogous to `go-tdx-guest` for TDX).

2. **Parse SEV-SNP Report**:
   - Use `abi.ReportToProto()` to parse the binary report.
   - Extract: `Measurement` (48 bytes), `ReportData` (64 bytes), TCB
     version, guest policy.

3. **Verify SEV-SNP Attestation**:
   - Fetch the VCEK certificate through Tinfoil’s KDS proxy; use embedded AMD
     ASK/ARK chains as described in [AMD certificate retrieval](#amd-certificate-retrieval).
   - Verify the report signature against the VCEK chain rooted at the applicable AMD ARK.
   - Validate guest policy (SMT=true, Debug=false, etc.).
   - Validate TCB minimums (BlSpl=0x07, TeeSpl=0x00, SnpSpl=0x0e,
     UcodeSpl=0x48).

4. **Return `SEVVerifyResult`**: analogous to `TDXVerifyResult`, with
   measurement, REPORTDATA, parse error, signature error, policy error.

5. **Integration into Tinfoil Attester**:
   - Detect platform from `cpu.platform` field (`sev-snp` or `tdx`).
   - For SEV-SNP, call the new SEV verifier instead of TDX.

**Unit tests**:
- Test SEV-SNP report parsing with captured attestation (testdata).
- Test VCEK chain validation.
- Test policy validation: valid, debug=true rejection, low TCB rejection.
- Test REPORTDATA extraction.

### EHBP E2EE Implementation

Teep implements the Encrypted HTTP Body Protocol for full-body request
encryption and response decryption.

**Core files**:
- `internal/e2ee/ehbp.go` — EHBP client transport (encrypt request, decrypt
  response)
- `internal/e2ee/ehbp_test.go` — Unit tests
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/e2ee.go` — Tinfoil RequestEncryptor

**Go dependency**: Use the standard `crypto/hpke` package for HPKE operations.

**Implementation**:

1. **EHBP Encryption** (`ehbp.go`):
   - `EncryptRequest(body io.Reader, serverPubKey [32]byte) (encBody io.ReadCloser, encapKey [32]byte, senderCtx, error)`:
     - Call HPKE `SetupBaseS` with X25519_HKDF_SHA256 / HKDF_SHA256 /
       AES_256_GCM and the server's public key.
     - Stream-encrypt the body into EHBP chunk framing; do not buffer entire
       multipart/audio payloads in memory.
     - Return an encrypted body reader, the encapsulated key, and the retained
       HPKE sender context for response decryption.

2. **EHBP Decryption** (`ehbp.go`):
   - `DecryptResponse(encBody io.Reader, responseNonce [32]byte, encapKey [32]byte, senderCtx) (io.ReadCloser, error)`:
     - Export secret: `secret = senderCtx.Export("ehbp response", 32)`.
     - Construct salt: `salt = encapKey || responseNonce`.
     - Derive PRK: `prk = HKDF-Extract(salt, secret)`.
     - Derive key: `aead_key = HKDF-Expand(prk, "key", 32)`.
     - Derive nonce: `aead_nonce = HKDF-Expand(prk, "nonce", 12)`.
     - Read chunks: `[4-byte len] [ciphertext]`.
     - Decrypt each chunk with AES-256-GCM:
       nonce = `aead_nonce XOR chunk_index`.
     - Reject oversized chunk lengths before allocation.
     - On any auth failure: fail closed, return error immediately.

3. **Streaming Response Decryption**:
   - `DecryptResponseStream(body io.Reader, nonce, encapKey, ctx) (io.Reader, error)`:
     - Wraps response body in a reader that decrypts chunks on-the-fly.
     - Used for SSE streaming responses.
     - Each read returns one decrypted chunk.

4. **Tinfoil RequestEncryptor** (`tinfoil/e2ee.go`):
   - Implements `provider.RequestEncryptor`.
   - `EncryptRequest(body, raw, endpointPath)`:
     - Extract HPKE public key from raw attestation. **Note**: storing the
       X25519 HPKE key in `raw.SigningKey` will be misidentified by
       `E2EEKeyType()` as Ed25519 (both are 64 hex chars). The implementation
       must either add `raw.SigningAlgo = "x25519-hpke"` to `knownSigningAlgos`
       in `attestation.go`, or use a dedicated HPKE key field on
       `RawAttestation` rather than co-opting `SigningKey`.
     - Call `ehbp.EncryptRequest(body, pubKey)`.
     - Return encrypted body bytes and an EHBP response handler.
   - **EHBP does not implement the existing `Decryptor` interface** from
     `e2ee/session.go`. That interface is field-level (hex string in, plaintext
     bytes out) and designed for Venice/NearCloud per-field encryption. EHBP is
     a full-body `io.Reader` transformer driven by response headers. EHBP
     follows the `ChutesE2EE`/`ChutesSession` pattern — a separate
     transport-level type with its own proxy integration path. The EHBP type
     should carry the HPKE sender context and encapsulated key, and provide a
     `DecryptResponse(resp *http.Response) (io.ReadCloser, error)` method that
     reads `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` from response headers and performs decryption.

5. **Proxy Integration**:
   - The proxy integration follows the `ChutesE2EE` pattern rather than the
     `Decryptor`-based field-level relay path. EHBP encryption/decryption is
     transport-level: the entire request body is encrypted before sending, and
     the entire response body is decrypted before the proxy parses SSE/JSON.
   - Set `Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key` header on the outgoing request.
   - Ensure encrypted requests have unknown content length (chunked transfer);
      never send encrypted body with fixed `Content-Length`.
   - On response: read `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` header, pass to Decryptor.
   - If `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` is missing: fail closed.
   - If `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` appears on a bodyless request path, fail closed
      (header presence mismatch).
   - For bodyless requests, do not attach EHBP headers and do not attempt
     decryption.

**Unit tests**:
- Test encryption round-trip: encrypt with a test key, decrypt with known
  private key.
- Test chunked framing: single chunk, multiple chunks, zero-length chunks.
- Test chunk length bounds: oversized length prefix is rejected fail-closed
   before allocation.
- Test response key derivation: verify against known test vectors (derive key
  from a known HPKE context and nonce, compare expected output).
- Test fail-closed: missing Ehbp-Response-Nonce, duplicate EHBP headers,
  unexpected Ehbp-Response-Nonce on bodyless requests, corrupted ciphertext.

### Provider Construction and Configuration

Both `tinfoil_v3_cloud` and `tinfoil_v3_direct` are connected to the proxy,
config, and endpoint dispatch.

**Core files**:
- `internal/proxy/proxy.go` — Provider construction, endpoint paths,
  TLS-binding dispatch; immutable direct-provider route selection
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/` — Shared V3 types and both provider variants
- `internal/verify/factory.go` — Attester/report-data verifier factory cases,
  default E2EE status, chat path, and `TINFOIL_API_KEY` env var mapping
- `internal/config/config.go` — `TINFOIL_API_KEY` env resolution
- `internal/attestation/report.go` — default allow-fail factors for both providers
- `docs/api_support.md` — endpoint and E2EE support matrices

**Shared package** (`internal/provider/tinfoil/`):

The attestation parsing, REPORTDATA verifier, policy checks, and EHBP
encryptor are shared between both providers. The package structure mirrors
`internal/provider/neardirect/` for the direct provider and adds router-specific
attestation handling for cloud routes.

1. **Config** (`config.go`):
   - Both providers use env var `TINFOIL_API_KEY`.
   - `tinfoil_v3_cloud` default base URL: `https://inference.tinfoil.sh`.
   - `tinfoil_v3_direct` uses `https://inference.tinfoil.sh` for discovery
     and model listing, then resolves a per-model backend URL per request.
   - E2EE default: `true` for both.

2. **`tinfoil_v3_cloud` Provider Construction**:

   [Provider construction](../../../internal/proxy/proxy.go) installs the
   Tinfoil attester, request preparer, EHBP encryptor, REPORTDATA verifier,
   cloud supply-chain policy, and validating model lister. `StaticRoute`
   contains the configured router origin and `tinfoil.RouterRepo`.
   Every model obtains its own authorization for that route.

3. **`tinfoil_v3_direct` Provider Construction**:

   Provider construction installs `DirectResolver.ResolveRoute` and a
   route-aware attester, together with the direct supply-chain policy.
   One immutable route contains the selected backend authority and effective
   repository. Attestation, authorization lookup, and inference use that
   snapshot. The [transport reference](../../transport/README.md) defines
   authorization and pool ownership.

4. **`tinfoil_v3_direct` Model-to-Domain Resolver**
   (`internal/provider/tinfoil/resolver.go`):

   Uses the router's proxy-discovery response with these Tinfoil-specific
   rules:
   - Discovery source:
     `GET https://inference.tinfoil.sh/.well-known/tinfoil-proxy`.
   - Domain source: use the backend enclave domains from
     `models[model].enclaves` exactly as returned, after validation.
   - Restrict domains to Tinfoil-owned suffixes:
     `.tinfoil.sh` or `.tinfoil.containers.tinfoil.dev`.
   - TTL: 5 minutes; collapsed concurrent refreshes via `singleflight`
     (`DoChan`).
   - When `prompt_cache_key` is present, select the backend domain by hashing
     the key with each domain and choosing the lowest hash; otherwise choose
     the lexicographically first domain for deterministic behavior.
   - Authorization keys include provider, model, and canonical authority so
     multiple backends for the same model cannot collide.

5. **`tinfoil_v3_direct` Supply Chain Repo Mapping**:

   For the direct provider, the Sigstore supply chain repo corresponds to the
   per-model inference enclave repository, not the router. The direct attester
   records the repo returned by `/.well-known/tinfoil-proxy` on
   `RawAttestation.TinfoilRepo`; proxy report helpers receive the immutable
   route repository selected before attestation. They do not resolve again. If the
   resolved repo does not have a valid release, hash, and DSSE attestation
   through `github-proxy.tinfoil.sh`, supply-chain verification fails closed.

6. **TLS fingerprint binding** (shared pattern, both providers):

   The current proxy does not create a dedicated Tinfoil transport type.
   Attestation fetches compare the live TLS peer SPKI against the attested
   `report_data.tls_key_fp`. Every inference handshake checks that pin before
   sending request bytes. Trust failures invalidate only the authorization
   generation used by the failed attempt.

7. **Allow-Fail Defaults**:

   `attestation.TinfoilCloudDefaultAllowFail` and
   `attestation.TinfoilDirectDefaultAllowFail` both include:
   - `cpu_id_registry` — `allow_fail` (Proof of Cloud identity-registry
     factor; Tinfoil currently has no PoC participation)
   - `intel_pcs_collateral` — `allow_fail` (SEV-SNP uses AMD KDS instead of
     Intel PCS; TDX collateral is still verified when applicable)
   - `component_recognition` — `allow_fail` (component identity drift is
     surfaced separately from enforced transparency and signature failures)
   - `nvswitch_binding` — `allow_fail` (reported separately while topology
     binding compatibility settles)
   - `response_schema` — `allow_fail` while Tinfoil V3 attestation schema
     compatibility settles

   `attestation.TinfoilCloudDefaultAllowFail` also includes
   `tee_cert_chain`, `tee_quote_signature`, `nvidia_payload_present`,
   `nvidia_signature`, `nvidia_claims`, and `cpu_gpu_chain` because the router
   path depends on AMD KDS/GPU evidence paths that are still noisy in live
   deployment.

   > Nonce binding and E2EE factors are `enforced` for both providers.
   > `build_transparency_log`, `provider_signer_recognition`,
   > `component_signature_recognition`, and `sigstore_code_verified` are
   > `enforced` for both providers.

8. **Config examples** (`teep.toml.example`):
   ```toml
   [providers.tinfoil_v3_cloud]
   base_url = "https://inference.tinfoil.sh"
   api_key_env = "TINFOIL_API_KEY"
   e2ee = true

   [providers.tinfoil_v3_direct]
   # base_url is not used for tinfoil_v3_direct; model discovery is automatic
   api_key_env = "TINFOIL_API_KEY"
   e2ee = true
   ```

9. **Responses + TTS Endpoints**:
   - `tinfoil_v3_cloud`: supports `/v1/responses`, `/v1/audio/speech`, and
     the other Tinfoil routes explicitly connected in `proxy.go`.
   - `tinfoil_v3_direct`: supports `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions`
     on all inference enclaves; audio/TTS only on enclaves that expose them
     per their `tinfoil-config.yml` `api_routes` configuration.
    - `/v1/realtime` and `/v1/convert/file` are deferred to `tinfoil_endpoints.md`.
    - Model is always required. Missing model is a fail-closed request error.
       The proxy must not silently inject default models — doing so makes a
       trust decision (which TEE to connect to) on behalf of the client.

**Unit tests**:
- Test provider construction from config for both `tinfoil_v3_cloud` and
  `tinfoil_v3_direct` (verifies correct Attester and ReportDataVerifier types).
- Test `internal/verify/factory.go` switch cases for both provider names.
- Test SPKI domain resolution: cloud provider returns single domain;
  direct provider delegates to resolver.
- Test direct resolver: proxy-discovery parsing, domain validation, cache TTL,
  singleflight collapse, offline fallback.
- Test direct resolver domain restriction: non-Tinfoil-owned suffixes rejected.
- Test supply chain repo mapping for both providers.
- Test that unknown Tinfoil config fields are rejected (strict TOML).

### Integration Tests

Full API-key-based integration tests cover both `tinfoil_v3_cloud` and
`tinfoil_v3_direct` providers against Tinfoil endpoints.

**Core files**:
- `internal/proxy/integration_tinfoil_test.go` — live proxy integration
  coverage for both `tinfoil_v3_cloud` and `tinfoil_v3_direct`
- `internal/integration/tinfoil_test.go` — captured/offline verification
  coverage
- `internal/integration/testdata/tinfoil_v3_cloud_*` — captured Tinfoil

   - Fetch attestation from `inference.tinfoil.sh` using the cloud attester.
   - Verify TDX or SEV-SNP quote.
   - Verify REPORTDATA binding (router HPKE key + nonce + GPU hashes).
   - Confirm `report_data.hpke_key` belongs to the **router** enclave.

2. **Supply Chain Verification (router repo)**:
   - Fetch code measurements from `tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router`.
   - Verify Sigstore bundle, compare against enclave measurements.

3. **TLS Fingerprint Binding**, **Client Nonce**, **GPU Evidence Verification**,
   **HPKE Key Authentication**.

7. **Realtime WebSocket and File Conversion**: deferred to `tinfoil_endpoints.md`.

8. **Negative Tests**:
   - (endpoint-specific negative tests deferred to `tinfoil_endpoints.md`)

**Tests for `tinfoil_v3_direct`** (require `TINFOIL_API_KEY`):

1. **Model Discovery**:
   - Call `GET https://inference.tinfoil.sh/.well-known/tinfoil-proxy`.
   - Verify resolver maps model IDs to returned backend enclave domains with
     valid Tinfoil-owned suffixes.
   - Verify TTL cache and refresh behavior.

2. **Per-Model Attestation Fetch and Verify**:
   - Fetch attestation from a direct inference enclave (e.g.
     `gemma4-31b-1.inf10.tinfoil.sh`) using the direct attester.
   - Verify TDX or SEV-SNP quote.
   - Verify REPORTDATA binding (inference enclave HPKE key + nonce + GPU hashes).
   - Confirm `report_data.hpke_key` belongs to the **inference** enclave
     (different from the router key returned by `tinfoil_v3_cloud`).

3. **Supply Chain Verification (per-model repo)**:
   - Fetch code measurements from the per-model Sigstore repo.
   - Verify Sigstore bundle, compare against inference enclave measurements.

4. **TLS Fingerprint Binding (per inference enclave)**:
   - Extract TLS fingerprint from per-enclave `report_data.tls_key_fp`.
   - Verify it differs from router TLS fingerprint.
   - Verify TLS connection to inference enclave uses the inference enclave cert.

5. **HPKE Key Ownership Verification**:
   - Verify HPKE key from inference enclave attestation differs from router
     attestation key for the same model.
   - This demonstrates the key security property of `tinfoil_v3_direct`.

6. **E2EE End-to-End**:
   - Verify chat request EHBP-encrypted to inference enclave's own HPKE key.
   - Verify response decrypted from inference enclave's EHBP response.

7. **Chat Completions (non-streaming and streaming)**:
   - Test with a model whose inference enclave is directly accessible.

8. **Embeddings** (model `nomic-embed-text`, resolved through proxy discovery)
9. **Realtime WebSocket and File Conversion**: deferred to `tinfoil_endpoints.md`.

10. **Negative Tests**:
   - Verify that supplying a model with no known direct enclave domain fails
     closed with explicit error.
   - Verify that a mismatched TLS fingerprint on the inference enclave
     triggers re-attestation and fails closed on continued mismatch.
   - Verify `/v1/audio/speech` fails closed when the target inference enclave
     does not expose that path.
   - (endpoint-specific negative tests deferred to `tinfoil_endpoints.md`)

**Fixture Tests** (offline, no API key, shared):
- Capture V3 attestation responses from both router and inference enclave
  and save as separate testdata fixtures.
- Test the full V3 verification pipeline against both fixtures.
- Refresh fixtures periodically to detect schema/policy drift.

### Verification Report and Documentation

Verification reports include Tinfoil-specific factors for both
`tinfoil_v3_cloud` and `tinfoil_v3_direct` providers.

**Core files**:
- `internal/attestation/report.go` — Tinfoil-specific verification factors,
  default allow-fail lists, and report-building behavior
- `internal/verify/verify.go` — verification orchestration and report
  construction
- `docs/api_support.md` — provider endpoint and E2EE summary

**Verification factor mapping** (reusing existing factors where possible):

Existing factors reused as-is:
- `tls_key_binding` — TLS fingerprint matches REPORTDATA[0:32]
- `e2ee_capable` — HPKE key extracted from attestation (subsumes key binding)
- `e2ee_usable` — Request encrypted and response authenticated via EHBP for
   HTTP body-carrying endpoints

TEE-generic factors:
- `tee_quote_present` — Hardware quote fetched
- `tee_quote_structure` — Quote parses correctly
- `tee_hardware_config` — Platform-specific policy
  (TDX: attributes, XFAM, MR_SEAM, RTMR3; SEV-SNP: guest policy, TCB)
- `tee_boot_config` — Boot measurements match expected
- `tee_tcb_current` — TCB SVN meets minimum
- `intel_pcs_collateral` — Remains Intel-specific (TDX only); AMD equivalent
  covered by VCEK chain validation within `tee_quote_structure`

New cross-provider factors:
- `sigstore_code_verified` — Code measurement verified via Sigstore DSSE bundle
- `cpu_id_registry` — Proof of Cloud CPU identity registration factor
   (proofofcloud.org), separate from register/measurement matching
   (reuses existing factor name)

Existing factors with provider-specific behavior:
- `measured_model_weights` — Set to `Pass` when `sigstore_code_verified`
  passes, because the Sigstore chain transitively authenticates model weights
  via tinfoil-config.yml → dm-verity. Detail: "model weights attested via
  dm-verity commitment in Sigstore-verified config"
- `nonce_in_reportdata` — `enforced`. Client nonce in REPORTDATA hash.
  Detail: "tinfoil v3: client nonce in REPORTDATA hash".

### Factor Status to Teep Policy Mapping

All factor status language in this document maps directly to teep policy modes:

| Term | Teep config/policy mode | Runtime meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enforced` | factor is NOT in `allow_fail` | Factor failure blocks request (fail-closed) |
| `allow_fail` | factor is in `allow_fail` | Factor failure is recorded but does not block by itself |
| `skip` | verifier emits `Skip` status | Factor is not applicable/unverifiable for that provider path; no pass claim is made |

Normalization rules for this document:
1. Use only `enforced`, `allow_fail`, or `skip` when describing factor policy.
2. Do not use `Advisory` or `Yes/No` for factor policy state.
3. `skip` is a verifier outcome status, not a config override; it means
    "not verifiable on this path" and must include explicit detail text.
4. `allow_fail` must always be justified in text (threat-model rationale).

**Documentation updates**:
- Add `tinfoil_v3_cloud` and `tinfoil_v3_direct` to the endpoint support matrix in `api_support.md`.
- Add Tinfoil E2EE details (EHBP, HPKE, full-body encryption).
- Document that both Tinfoil providers have **no field-level encryption gaps**
   for HTTP body-carrying APIs (full-body EHBP).
- Document the HPKE key ownership distinction: `tinfoil_v3_cloud` EHBP key is the router's; `tinfoil_v3_direct` EHBP key is the inference enclave's.
- Note provider names `tinfoil_v3_cloud` (router) and `tinfoil_v3_direct` (direct).

---

## Verification Factors Summary

Both providers use the same factor names, with a small number of provider-
specific default `allow_fail` differences. The key distinction is **what
enclave is attested**: `tinfoil_v3_cloud` attests the router;
`tinfoil_v3_direct` attests the inference enclave. The `e2ee_capable` and
`tls_key_binding` factor descriptions reflect this distinction at the
detail-string level.

### `tinfoil_v3_cloud` and `tinfoil_v3_direct` Factors (shared)

| Factor | Teep Policy Mode | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tee_quote_present` | `enforced` | Hardware quote fetched and non-empty |
| `tee_quote_structure` | `enforced` | Quote parses and signature verifies (TDX or SEV-SNP) |
| `tee_hardware_config` | `enforced` | Platform policy (TDX: attrs/XFAM/MR_SEAM/RTMR3; SEV-SNP: guest policy/TCB) |
| `tee_boot_config` | `enforced` | Boot measurements match expected (MRTD/RTMR0 or measurement) |
| `tee_tcb_current` | `enforced` | TCB SVN meets minimum threshold |
| `intel_pcs_collateral` | `allow_fail` (default; TDX only) | Intel collateral valid when TDX collateral is required; N/A for SEV-SNP |

#### TEE-Generic Factor Names

The current implementation uses `tee_*` factor names for CPU-TEE checks that
apply across both Intel TDX and AMD SEV-SNP. Intel-specific collateral remains
under `intel_pcs_collateral`; AMD VCEK chain validation is part of the
SEV-SNP quote verification path. Config validation rejects unknown factor
names at startup, so user `allow_fail` lists must use the current `tee_*`
names.

## Dependencies

Go module dependencies used by the Tinfoil implementation:
- `github.com/google/go-sev-guest` — AMD SEV-SNP verification
- `crypto/hpke` — HPKE operations for EHBP
- `github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go` — Sigstore bundle verification

## Risk Assessment

1. **SEV-SNP is new attestation hardware for teep**: Tinfoil uses SEV-SNP for
   live router and inference deployments, so the provider depends on
   `go-sev-guest` parsing, VCEK chain verification, guest policy validation,
   and TCB checks in addition to the existing TDX path.

2. **EHBP is a new E2EE protocol**: Unlike existing field-level or ML-KEM
   protocols, EHBP uses HPKE (RFC 9180). The protocol is well-specified with
   reference implementations in Go, JS, and Swift.

3. **Supply chain model differs**: Tinfoil uses Sigstore/GitHub Actions
   attestations rather than compose-hash/IMA. This is a stronger model (code
   measurement signed by transparent CI) but requires new verification code.

4. **Router architecture** (`tinfoil_v3_cloud`): Tinfoil uses a confidential
   model router that handles multiple models. The attestation covers the
   router, not individual models. This is similar to nearcloud's gateway model.
   The router performs second-hop verification of each model enclave internally
   — teep trusts this because the router code is Sigstore-attested.

5. **Per-model endpoint availability** (`tinfoil_v3_direct`): Not all inference
   enclaves expose all endpoints. The `api_routes` field in each model's
   `tinfoil-config.yml` determines which paths are served. The direct provider
   must fail closed on any attempt to use an unsupported path for a given model.
   Integration tests must validate path availability before treating an absence
   as a provider error.

6. **Model weight authentication is fully solved** (both providers): Unlike all
   existing teep providers, Tinfoil's model weights are cryptographically bound
   into the attestation chain via dm-verity + tinfoil-config.yml + Sigstore.
   The `measured_model_weights` factor can be set to `Pass` when the Sigstore
   supply chain verification succeeds (see Authentication Chain 4 above).
   For `tinfoil_v3_direct`, this applies to the per-model inference enclave's
   Sigstore bundle. For `tinfoil_v3_cloud`, this applies transitively via the
   router's supply chain (which attests the code that verifies inference enclaves).
   This is a significant advantage over dstack providers where
   `measured_model_weights` always returns `Fail`.

   Status rule:
   - `tinfoil_v3_direct`: `Closed` only when the per-model enclave chain passes.
   - `tinfoil_v3_cloud`: `Closed` only at router-mediated trust boundary;
     direct model-enclave proof at teep boundary remains `Open`.

7. **TEE.fail is unmitigated**: Tinfoil has no Proof of Cloud participation,
   no vTPM, and no DCEA. DDR5 memory bus key extraction attacks can forge
   TDX/SEV-SNP quotes with arbitrary measurements and REPORTDATA, defeating
   all software-layer security guarantees including Sigstore measurement
   matching and E2EE key binding. This is the same vulnerability affecting
   all TEE providers. `cpu_id_registry` is the Proof-of-Cloud identity factor;
   because Tinfoil currently has no PoC participation, it remains a default
   `allow_fail` factor. See "Authentication Chain 5" for full analysis.

   Applies to: both providers equally.

8. **GPU-CPU binding**: GPU evidence is bound into REPORTDATA (Option 2 from
   gpu_cpu_binding.md), preventing GPU splicing attacks in the absence of
   TEE.fail. The nonce in REPORTDATA also provides freshness for GPU evidence.

   Applies to: both providers, with boundary scope difference:
   `tinfoil_v3_cloud` closes at router enclave boundary; `tinfoil_v3_direct`
   closes at inference enclave boundary.

9. **Format evolution risk**: The V3 attestation format is fully deployed, but
   protocol fields and evidence policy can evolve (for example
   architecture-specific NVSwitch requirements). Keep the attester/verifier
   isolated so updates can be shipped without disrupting other providers.
   Keep fixture-based regression tests active to detect schema/policy drift.
   The nonce requirement also safeguards against silent legacy-format
   downgrade: the attester always requests nonce-based attestation and rejects
   any response without a `report_data` structured field.

10. **WebSocket `/v1/realtime` reduced defense-in-depth**: Deferred to
   `tinfoil_endpoints.md`. WebSocket has no EHBP body-layer encryption;
   relies solely on attested TLS.

11. **Independent V3 verification coverage**: Public client libraries may have
   incomplete V3 verification coverage. Teep must maintain independent V3
   verification (envelope signature, REPORTDATA hash, GPU evidence hash
   binding, and nonce checks) and fixture-based regression tests.
